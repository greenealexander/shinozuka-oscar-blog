## Overall Review

"Sharp Objects" by Gillian Flynn is a dark and gripping psychological thriller that delves into the depths of human dysfunction and explores the consequences of unresolved trauma. It is a haunting and disturbing novel that showcases Flynn's masterful storytelling and her ability to create deeply flawed and complex characters.

The story follows Camille Preaker, a journalist with a troubled past, as she returns to her hometown to investigate the murders of two young girls. Camille is a deeply flawed protagonist who struggles with self-harm, emotional vulnerability, and a strained relationship with her family. Flynn's writing immerses the reader in the oppressive atmosphere of the small town of Wind Gap, Missouri, where dark secrets lurk behind every corner.

The novel deals with disturbing themes such as self-harm, violence, and child abuse. These topics are explored in a raw and unflinching manner, which can be unsettling for some readers. The novel's unrelenting darkness and bleakness may not appeal to those seeking a more lighthearted or uplifting read. Furthermore, since this novel focuses heavily on character, those looking for a police procedural crime fiction novel should look elsewhere. If you are into noir, then you're going to love this book.

## Character: Physical Manifestation of Interal Trauma

Camille, a journalist who returns to her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri, to investigate the murders of two young girls, is multifaceted and complex. These elements intertwine to create a psychological portrait of a deeply troubled woman. Gillian Flynn's writing delves into Camille's psyche and explores the impacts of her past trauma on her present behavior and relationships.

### Self-Harm

Camille has a history of self-harm and bears numerous scars on her body. She engages in cutting herself as a coping mechanism for emotional pain and trauma. The scars serve as a physical representation of her inner turmoil. What I found even more fascinating was the way the author connected her self-harming behavior to her profession. Camille didn't just cut lines into her skin, she carved words. Her obsession with words and writing makes it only natural that she be a journalist. 

Her habit covered almost her entire body, permanently. She was extremely self-conscious of showing her skin, even going as far as keeping her clothes on during sex, which wasn't an easy thing to do. A great metaphor of how she struggles with emotional vulnerability; scared of revealing the trauma that hides beneath her layers of complexity.
