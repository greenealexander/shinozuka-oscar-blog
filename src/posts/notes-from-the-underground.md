>The wretched mouse, in addition to the one original nastiness, has already managed to fence itself about with so many other nastiness in the form of questions and doubts; it has padded out the one question with so many unresolved questions that, willy-nilly, some fatal sloths have accumulated around it, some stinking filth consisting of its dubieties, anxieties, and, finally, of the spit raining on it from ingenuous figures who stand solemnly around it like judges and dictators, guffawing at it from all their healthy gullets. Of course, nothing remains for it but to wave the whole thing outside with his little paw and, with a smile of feigned contempt, in which it does not believe itself, slip back shamefacedly into its crack. There, and it’s loathsome , Stinking underground, our offended, beaten-down, and derided mouse at once immerses itself in cold, venomous, and, above all, everlasting spite. For 40 years on end he will recall it’s offense to the last, most shameful details, each time adding even more shameful details of its own, spitefully taunting and chafing itself with his fantasy. He will be ashamed of his fantasies, but all the same it will recall everything, go over everything, keep all sorts of figments on itself, under the pretext that they, too, could have happened, and forgive nothing.

>I repeat, I emphatically repeat: ingenuous people and active figures are all active simply because they are dull and narrow minded how to explain it? Here’s how: as a consequence of their narrow mindedness, they take the most immediate and secondary causes for the primary ones, and thus become convinced more quickly and easily than others that they have found an indisputable basis for their doings, and so they feel at ease; and that, after all, is the main thing. For in order to begin to act, one must first be completely at ease, so that no more doubts remain. Well, and how am I, for example, to set myself at ease? Where are the primary causes on which I can rest, where are my bases? Where am I going to get them? I exercise thinking, and, consequently, for me every primary cause immediately drags with it yet another, still more primary one, and so on ad infinitum. Such is precisely the essence of all consciousness and thought.

>Suppose, gentlemen, that man is not stupid. (really, he’s quite impossible to say he is, for the sole reason that if he is stupid, who then is intelligent?) but even if he isn’t stupid, all the same he’s monstrously ungrateful! Phenomenally ungrateful. I even think the best definition of man is: a being that goes on two legs and it’s on grateful.

>You, for example, want to make a man on learn his old habits, and to correct his will in conformity with the demands of science and common sense. But how do you know that man that only can be but must be remade in this way? What makes you conclude that man’s wanting so necessarily needs to be corrected? In short, how do you know that such a correction will indeed be profitable for man? …So far, it’s still just your supposition. <br>[...] Allow me an observation. I agree: man is predominantly a creating animal, deemed to strive consciously thought a goal and to occupy himself with the art of engineering – that is, do eternally and ceaselessly make a road for him so that at least goes somewhere or other. But sometimes he may wish to swerve aside, precisely because he is doomed to open this road, and also perhaps because, stupid The movie ingenuous the year generally is, it still sometimes occurs to him that this road almost always turns out to go somewhere or other, and the main thing is not where it goes, but that it should simply be going, and that the well-behaved child, by neglecting the art of engineering, not give himself up to pernicious idleness, which, as is known, is the mother of all vice. 
[...] Man loves creating and making of roads, that is indisputable. But why does he so passionately love destruction and chaos as well? Tell me that!
<cite>Fyodor Dostoyevski, pg. 32 </cite>


>And why are you so firmly, so solemnly convinced that only the normal and the positive, in short, that only well-being, is profitable for man? [...] suffering, for example, is inadmissible in vaudevilles, I know that. In a crystal palace it is even unthinkable: suffering is doubt, it is negation, and what good is a crystal palace in which one can have doubts? And yet I am certain that man will never renounce real suffering, that is, destruction and chaos. Suffering – why, this is the sole cause of consciousness.

>In every man’s memories there are such things as he will reveal not to everyone, but perhaps only to friends. There are also such as the reveal not even different, but only to himself, and that in secret. Then, finally, there are such as a man is afraid to reveal even to himself, and every decent man will have accumulated quite a few things of this sort. That is, one might even say: the more decent a man is, the more of them he will have.

>Do not think, however, that I turn coward before the officer out of cowardice: in my soul I have never been a coward, though I constantly turn coward in reality, but—don’t laugh too quickly, there is an explanation for that; rest assured, I have an explanation for everything.
<cite>Fyodor Dostoyevski, pg. 49</cite>

>And in fact I’m now asking an idle question of my own: which is better—cheap happiness, or lofty suffering? Well, which is better?
