## Creative Imagination: Metaphores That Paint A Clear Picture

>Marisa was simultaneously fascinated and horrified by the baby. It seemed strange that this alien being had been squashed up in her mother's stomch and had emerged, bearing only the vaguest resemblances to a proper human, with skin so thin and stretched it seemed almost tanslucent. The baby's fingers were tiny as maggots, her eyes cloudy like apple juice. And all the gown-ups were mad about her, this squalling newborn, who had no personality as far as Marisa coulde see.
<cite>Elizabeth Day, pg. 17</cite>

>She lay awake for a long time, feeling the slug trail of tears on her face, and she made a promise to herself that she would never talk about it again. She would pretend not to mind, and in this way, she would grow strong and careless and no one else would ever be able to hurt her.
<cite>Elizabeth Day, pg. 26</cite>

>She had been smitten and only later had she thought to question the fact that "smitten" came from the verb "to smite," something more often associated with angry deities meting out dramatic lightning bolts of punishment and that, when she Googled the original etymology, actually meant "to smear or blemish" and wasn't romantic at all.
<cite>Elizabeth Day, pg. 40</cite>

>She watches the interactions between Jake and Kate with morbid fascination. She tells herself she doesn't want to find any further evidence of their closeness and yet, at the same time, she is compelled to do so. She wants her suspicions proved right, while at the same time knowing that this will undo her. It will smash apart everything she has ever wanted. It will destroy the only relationship she has ever been able to trust. But she keeps returning to it, a freshly formed scab that she starts to pick at with the tip of her finger, worrying the edges as if to test the strength of the rust-dried platelets, the web of fragile new skin.
<cite>Elizabeth Day, pg. 90</cite>

>In her study, she watches the sun rise. The clouded sky goes nicotine yellow. Her desk turns sepia in the light. It is too bright.
<cite>Elizabeth Day, pg. 97</cite>

>In November, Kate was determined that she would initiate sex at all the most fertile moments in her cycle, but it was difficult to do this in a way that seemed natural or sensual because she was in her head so much of the time they were actually making love. Would this be the time they conceived, she would ask herself as Jake fucked her, and would she know, would she feel any differently, would there be some cosmic sign that this was it? And should she stay lying down for half an hour afterward as she had read you were meant to, so that the sperm had time to make their way up up your cervix? And should she put her legs up to help them along? Except that would look ridiculous and still she didn't want to let on to Jake that she cared so much. She didn't want him to obsessed as she was, and yet at the same time, she worried that he was fixated on a baby and she was letting him down. All of this whirred through her mind when they had sex, and when Jake was on the verge of coming, she sometimes pretended she was too, so that it would be over. After all, what did her own pleasure count when she was failing so conspicuoulsy to do the thing other women did without thinking.

> Annabelle pretends she doesn't need to hear it, but she lets Jake carry on talking and Kate watches as she grows rosy and cintented, fattened like a maggot by all the compliments.
<cite>Elizabeth Day, pg. 257</cite>

>Anxiety clouds her thoughts like condensation on a mirror. Does he really need to be away so often? Why is he was working so much? Why has he turned off the tracking app he used to have on his phone?
<cite>Elizabeth Day, pg. 277</cite>

>...two flawed people, fitted into each other's failings like ivy burrowing into the loosening gaps between brick. You couldn't cut back the ivy without risking the house falling down. But the stone would crumble eventually, weakened by the insistent force of the plant pushing its thickening stem into every soft place. And then there would be collapse, a cloud of imploded stone. That is how it would end.
<cite>Elizabeth Day, pg. 309</cite>
