description: I don’t usually bother to pay any attention to the reviews/praise of a book because I often find them completely over the top with senseless exaggerations. However, in this instance, they were one hundred percent spot on. I seldomly find a book that I finish so quickly, but reading The Silent Patient was effortless. The twists were simply genius and geniusly simple. This book is literally perfect! It’s a book that I’d recommend over and over, and it’s crazy to think that Alex Michaelides's second book, The Maidens, another psychological thriller and mystery, is rated higher than The Silent Patient. I’m definitely going to buy it!

## Overall Review

After reading one of Naomi Hirahara’s cozy mysteries, Murder On Bamboo Lane—a book I found to be lackluster to say the least; I was looking for a book that had more complexity and depth on an emotional and analytical level. Unfortunately, or perhaps, fortunately, I essentially went broke and had to rely on the unread books sitting in my closet to satisfy this strong craving. 

As I scoured through my grungy closet, I carefully examined my dust-coated books, one by one wiping them clean, but with each book I picked up, my shoulders shrugged further forward until I essentially fell on my head. There wasn’t a single book that seemed even vaguely interesting to me. As I was about to resort to reading a book about the Japanese economy, I saw a book hidden underneath a stale T-shirt, poking out just enough for me to be able to read the author’s name on the spine, which read “Alex Michaelides.” 

After rescuing the book—and doing a load of laundry—I read the back cover, which had one of the shortest descriptions I’d ever seen with only four short sentences. “Alicia Berenson lived a seemingly perfect life until one day six years ago. When she shot her husband in the head five times. Since then she hasn’t spoken a single word. It’s time to find out why.” Immediately I was intrigued and opened the book.

The first thing that I saw when I flipped open the cover was a list of quotes praising The Silent Patient:

>“The rarest of beasts: the perfect thriller. This extraordinary novel set my blood fizzing - I quite literally couldn’t put it down. I told myself I’d just dip in; eleven hours later - it’s now 5:47 AM - I’ve finished it, absolutely dazzled.”
— A.J. Finn, author of The Woman in the Window

>“The Silent Patient sneaks up on you like a slash of intimidating shadow on a badly lit street. Michaelides has crafted a totally original, spellbinding psychological mystery so quirky, so unique that it should have its own genre. I read it in two nights and savoured every luscious word, every grim encounter, every startling twist. The pages will burn with the friction from your hands turning them.”
— David Baldacci

>“He that has eyes and ears to hear may convince himself that no mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore. ”

>‘I wanted to help people, I suppose,’ I said, with a shrug. ‘That’s it, really.’
Which was bullshit.
I mean, of course I wanted to help people. But that was a secondary aim - particularly at the time I started training. The real motivation was purely selfish. I was on a quest to help myself. I believe that the same is true for most people who go into mental health. We are drawn to this particular profession because we are damaged - we study psychology to heal ourselves. Whether we are prepared to admit this or not is another question.

>I took off my shoes on my way here, and walked barefoot. It reminded me of when I was little, and I’d play outside. It reminded me of another hot summer, hot like this one—the summer Mum died [...] In my memory that summer lasts forever. I remember Mum and those colourful tops she’d wear, with the yellow stringy straps, so flimsy and delicate - just like her. She was so thin, like a little bird. She would put on the radio and pick me up and dance me around to pop songs. I remember how she smelled of shampoo and cigarettes and Nivea hand cream, always with an undertone of vodka. How old was she then? Twenty-eight? Twenty-nine? She was younger then than I am now.
That’s an odd thought.
On my way here I saw a small bird on the path, lying by the roots of a tree. I thought it must have fallen from its nest. It wasn’t moving and I wondered if it had broken its wings. I stroked its head gently with my finger. It didn’t react. I nudged it and turned it over - and the underside of the bird was gone, eaten away, leaving a cavity filled with maggots. Fat, white, slippery maggots... twisting, turning, writhing... I felt my stomach turn - I thought I was going to be sick. It was so foul, so disgusting - deathly.
I can’t get it out of my mind.

There is a link between the plot of the story and a Greek story of Alcestis. I’ve always been a huge fan of Greek mythological stories since grade school—another reason why this book is an immediate favorite of mine. I have always appreciated how authors attempt to link their stories to mythology. This was my first time hearing of this particular Greek myth, which was not only an amazing story about betrayal, but the way Alex Michaelides ties it into his own story was flawless.
