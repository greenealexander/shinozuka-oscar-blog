description: The book is a deep look into the Meiji Restoration (what writers generally refer to as the "Bakumatsu") through the eyes of Katsu Kaishu, the founder of the first Japanese navy and one of the most important men during the Restoration. Based on Kaishu's journals, memoirs, histories, and letters, are great stories of Saigo Takamori, Sakamoto Ryoma, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, and many others, demonstrating not only the political and economic aspects of life during this period but also the cultural and interpersonal sides, which made this beautifully written and well-organized record of the Meiji Restoration, one of the first history books that I had a difficult time putting down. This is a book I highly recommend to anyone—including absolute beginners of Japanese history like myself, interested in the most integral events leading to the modernization of Japan but doesn’t want to read a straight-up textbook.

## Overall Review

I’ve always wanted to write a story set during the Edo period but realized that I knew very little about that part of Japanese history—or any of it for that matter. I’ve always had this fascination with samurai and the Edo period, but when I decided to do some reading on the subject, I found it very hard to find good books on the topic. Of the few books that were listed on Amazon, I chose Samurai Revolution by Romulus Hillsborough, since it seemed like it would read more like a novel than a boring textbook—fortunately, I was right.

The book is a deep look into the Meiji Restoration (what writers generally refer to as the "Bakumatsu") through the eyes of Katsu Kaishu, the founder of the first Japanese navy and one of the most important men during the Restoration. Based on Kaishu's journals, memoirs, histories, and letters, are great stories of Saigo Takamori, Sakamoto Ryoma, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, and many others, demonstrating not only the political and economic aspects of life during this period but also the cultural and interpersonal sides, which made this beautifully written and well-organized record of the Meiji Restoration, one of the first history books that I had a difficult time putting down. This is a book I highly recommend to anyone—including absolute beginners of Japanese history like myself, interested in the most integral events leading to the modernization of Japan but doesn’t want to read a straight-up textbook.

One suggestion from my own experience reading this book is to not worry about remembering all the names of the people mentioned. Hillsborough was very thorough, so when he was listing the people at a certain event, the list can go on and on. Unless you are a scholar, there’s no need to memorize all of the names. There are a handful of people that will be mentioned over and over again and it is those names that I recommend paying most attention to.

## My Favorite Section of the Book: Satsuma Han

My favorite section of the book was a section on Satsuma han, current-day Nagasaki in Western Kyushu. In the section, it mentioned how young Satsuma samurai were trained in an extremely lethal style of kenjutsu, a sword style that “empathized killing an opponent with a single blow,” using long swords measuring close to four feet, and they were taught to not fear death. The following was a story of some young Satsuma samurai who committed offenses to prove to their superiors that they did not fear death:

> Each spring in Satsuma it was customary for samurai to gather for a hunting expedition under the command of their daimyo. Since the hunt was a form of military training, the men were placed in strict formation and required to synchronize the firing of their guns. Matsuura Seizan reported that upon such an occasion, one of the men fired his gun out of synch with the others. The daimyo got angry and warned everyone that such disorder would not be tolerated; the next time a man committed such an offense he would be ordered to commit seppuku. No sooner had the men resumed their formation for the hunt, than dozens of them fired their guns haphazardly.
> <br>Infuriated, the daimyo insisted on knowing the names of those who had committed the latest offense. Numerous men immediately stepped forward to claim responsibility. When asked why they had committed the offense, they replied that they had felt obligated to do so because they had been admonished not to under the pain of death. Heeding the warning would have been the same as fearing death, they said; and to prove they were not afraid to die, they begged their daimyo to order them to rip open their bellies on the spot.

There was also a great section on bushido referencing the Hagakure, the most extensive book on bushido, as well as Yukio Mishima, a famous Japanese author who publicly committed seppuku in 1970. In addition, there was a section where Kaishu went to San Fransisco—which is full of interesting diary entries of his thoughts on the way Americans carried themselves and the way they treated women.
