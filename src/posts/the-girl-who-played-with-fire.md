Starting out as a hater of books, mostly due to being forced to read books that I had zero interest by teachers in school growing up, I preferred watching movies. I first discovered the trilogy written by Steig Larsson after watching the movie <i>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</i> starring Daniel Craig. I went to the school the following day excited to tell my friends about the new film I'd seen. But that excitement soon turned to dissapointment as my friends told me that they had already seen the movie years ago. "The book is better," they said. I scoffed at the comment. Not only had I been late in finding the movie, apparently the book is suppoe=sed to be better. <i>How could a book be better than a movie?</i>

Eventually almost a decade later, after graduating from university, moving to Japan, and finally changing my perspective on reading, at long last I bought the entire trilogy.

## Overall Review

I really enjoyed reading the first book of this trilogy, <i> The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,</i> which was thrilling from beginning to end. <i> The Girl Who Played With Fire,</i> though it was also an enjoyable read, was not as good. I must admit that it took me about a month, maybe two, just to finish the first half of the book.

Most of the first few hundred pages were used to introduce a several new characters, two being Dag Svensson and Mia Johansson. This couple had reached out to Millenium in hopes of publishing their research on sex-trafficking that would expose men, including many men who have ties to the Sweidsh Police. 

The parts that I found more interesting were the chapters about either Mikael Blomkvist or Lisbeth Salander. I fell in love with these two characters in the first book, and I liked catching up on what they were up to, Lisbeth especially. 

Another saving grace that got me through the uneventful earlier sections of the book was the captivating writing style of Steig Larsson which engrossed me even more as things started to pick up in the second half. Although it took me a while to read the first 300 pages, the last 300 or so pages only took days. 

Overall, it had a very slow start, but if you can get past that, you defintely won't be dissapointed.

## Reading For Inspiration: Mark Cuban, Hunting Ammunition

I've spent about a year now writing, trying to improve little by little everyday. Since it is a goal of mine to write a novel one day,  

Vanity Fair: “I'll read hours every day because all it takes is one little thing to propel you to the next level.”Oct 23, 2017

> "We'll have to wait for forensics, but I'm guessing that the killer used hunting ammunition. There were massive wounds in both victims."

> <br>The team considered this summary in silence. It was a debate that none of them needed to be reminded of. There are two types of ammunition: hard, full-metal-jacketed bullets that go straight through the body and cause comparatively modest damage, and soft ammunition that expands in the body on impact and does enormous damage. There is a vast difference between hitting a person with a bullet that's nine millimeters in diameter and a bullet that expands to a couple of centimetres or more in diameter. The latter type is called hunting ammunition, and its objective is to cause massive bleeding. It is considered more humane when hunting moose, since the aim is to put down the prey as quickly and painlessly as possible. But hunting ammunition is forbidden for use in war by international law, because a soldier hit by an expanding bullet almost always dies, no matter where the point of entry.
