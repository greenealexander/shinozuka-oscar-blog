### Overall Review

The story revolves around a lavish wedding ceremony on a secluded island called Inis Amploir. The bride, the groom, and their guests gather to celebrate this joyous occasion, but tensions simmer beneath the surface. As the stormy weather intensifies and old resentments resurface, the festivities take a dark turn when a murder occurs.

Foley masterfully crafts a claustrophobic and eerie atmosphere, emphasizing the isolated nature of the island and the gathering of characters who each have their own motives and secrets. The shifting perspectives allow readers to see the events unfold from different angles, gradually revealing the layers of deception and uncovering the truth behind the murder.

The characterization in "The Guest List" is well-developed, and Foley skillfully plays with reader expectations, making it challenging to discern the true nature and motivations of the characters. Each has a distinctive voice and a hidden agenda, adding to the intrigue and keeping readers guessing until the final pages.

The pacing of the novel is taut, with suspense building steadily as the storm rages outside and tensions escalate among the guests. Foley adeptly juggles multiple storylines, expertly intertwining past and present events, and the mystery unfolds through a series of revelations and twists that will keep readers engaged and eager to uncover the truth. 

If you don’t feel like reading it, I’d recommend you check out the audiobook version on Audible in which the voice actors do an amazing job. The story takes place in Ireland and the voice actress has an amazing Irish accent.

## Goosebumps: Unique and Effective Wordplay 

One of my many weak points that I find in my own writing is the lack of unique and effective wordchoice. My favorite authors, even my favorite rappers, use very unique words when they describe an emotion or situation that they themselves or someone else is experiencing. When done well it never ceases to give me goosebumps.



>I allow myself to begin to move in time with him, to the music. I allow him to move a little nearer, his eyes on mine. Perhaps I move closer, too. Close enough that I can smell his sweat—but clean sweat, a good smell. There’s a stirring in the pit of my stomach. A little sting of want.

## My Favorite Part of the Book

Page 221
>Dad turns to me. “I love you so much… clever, complicated, fierce daughter of mine.” Oh God. They aren’t pretty tears, either, a subtle glistening of the eyes. They spill over onto my cheeks and I have to put up the heel of a hand, then my napkin, to try and staunch them. What is happening to me? “And here’s the thing,” Dad says, to the crowd. “Even though Jules is this incredible, independent person, I like to flatter myself that she is my little girl. Because there are certain emotions, as a parent, that you can't escape… no matter what a shite one you’ve been, no matter how little right you have to them. And one of those is the instinct to protect.” He turns to me again. I have to look at him now. He wears an expression of genuine tenderness. My chest hurts. And then he trunks to Will. “William, you seem like…a great guy.” Was it just me, or was there a dangerous emphasis on the “seem”? “But,” Dad grins—I know that grin. It isn’t a smile at all. It's a baring of teeth. “You better look after my daughter. You better not feck this up. And if you do anything to hurt my girl—well, it’s simple.” He raises his glass, in a silent toast. “I’ll come for you.” There’s a strained silence. I force out a laugh, though it seems to come out more like a sob. There’s a ripple in its wake, other guests following suit—relieved, perhaps, to know how to take it. Ah, it’s a joke. Only it wasn’t a joke. I know it, Dad knows it—and I suspect, from the look on Will’s face, he knows it too.
