### Overall Review

After reading Finders Keepers, yet another Stephen King novel—another fantastic read by the way—I decided to look for something new by someone that I’ve never encountered before. Logging into my Goodreads account, I found a curated list of new and highly rated mysteries being recommended to me, and it didn’t take long for me to pick The Guest List by Lucy Foley. 

Before making my decision, I listened to a sample of the audiobook to make sure that I would enjoy the writing style. This is something that I have started doing more often since I have read some books recently that, in my opinion, was so poorly written that they would instantly put me to sleep or just straight-up irk me to the point of putting them down in search of something better. The Guest List was the Goodreads Choice 2020 Winner, which already gave me more confidence in choosing the book myself, but in addition to that, the synopsis immediately hook, line, and sinkered me. Here is part of the description provided on Goodreads:

“But perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped and the festivities begin, resentments and petty jealousies begin to mingle with the reminiscences and well wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from their school days. The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally ruins her dress. The bride’s oldest (male) friend gives an uncomfortably caring toast. And then someone turns up dead. Who didn’t wish the happy couple well? And perhaps more important, why?”

At first, I thought that this was going to be a straightforward read where one character—in this case, the criminal—has some secret grudge against either the bride or the groom, and so one of them would inevitably be found dead, then the story would unfold like a standard whodunnit mystery. I was pleasantly surprised by how the story develops and how characters' pasts are revealed to me, the reader, and to the characters themselves. It sort of reminds me of the book <i>A Nearly Normal Family</i> by BLANK where the story split into three parts, each part being a separate perspective of the same events. <i>The Guest List</i> however, instead of seperating each perspective into parts, each perspective is broken into chapters, and each perspective is set in a rotation of sorts like a poker game. 

I've read a few books written in this kind of style where the book is written in different perspectives, and I'm starting to realize that I really enjoy this style. From my own experience, I think that it's much harder to write a story from more than one point of view, and so I can really appreciate it when an author has done it successfully. The deep intertwinement of details and emotions—that keep you guessing from start to finish—compliments the psychological thriller genre extremely well. You won't be disappointed.

Also, if you don’t feel like reading it, I’d recommend you check out the audiobook version on Audible in which the voice actors do an amazing job. The story takes place in Ireland and the voice actress who plays one of the female characters, don’t remember which one, has an amazing Irish accent.

### More Goosebumps: Unique and Effective Wordplay 

One of my many weak points that I find in my own writing is the lack of unique and effective wordchoice. My favorite authors, even my favorite rappers, use very unique words when they describe an emotion or situation that they themselves or someone else is experiencing. When done well it never ceases to give me goosebumps.

>I allow myself to begin to move in time with him, to the music. I allow him to move a little nearer, his eyes on mine. Perhaps I move closer, too. Close enough that I can smell his sweat—but clean sweat, a good smell. There’s a stirring in the pit of my stomach. A little sting of want.

### My Favorite Part of the Book

>Dad turns to me. “I love you so much… clever, complicated, fierce daughter of mine.” Oh God. They aren’t pretty tears, either, a subtle glistening of the eyes. They spill over onto my cheeks and I have to put up the heel of a hand, then my napkin, to try and staunch them. What is happening to me? “And here’s the thing,” Dad says, to the crowd. “Even though Jules is this incredible, independent person, I like to flatter myself that she is my little girl. Because there are certain emotions, as a parent, that you can't escape… no matter what a shite one you’ve been, no matter how little right you have to them. And one of those is the instinct to protect.” He turns to me again. I have to look at him now. He wears an expression of genuine tenderness. My chest hurts. And then he trunks to Will. “William, you seem like…a great guy.” Was it just me, or was there a dangerous emphasis on the “seem”? “But,” Dad grins—I know that grin. It isn’t a smile at all. It's a baring of teeth. “You better look after my daughter. You better not feck this up. And if you do anything to hurt my girl—well, it’s simple.” He raises his glass, in a silent toast. “I’ll come for you.” There’s a strained silence. I force out a laugh, though it seems to come out more like a sob. There’s a ripple in its wake, other guests following suit—relieved, perhaps, to know how to take it. Ah, it’s a joke. Only it wasn’t a joke. I know it, Dad knows it—and I suspect, from the look on Will’s face, he knows it too.
