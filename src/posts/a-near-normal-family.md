description: This was the first book that I read after about a decade without reading a single book. This book just happened to be suggested by Amazon—how they knew I would be interested in this book is beyond me, and the author was a mystery to me as well, but I am so grateful to have found this book.

## Overall Review

"A Nearly Normal Family" by M.T. Edvardsson is a gripping and thought-provoking psychological thriller that delves into the complexities of family relationships and the lengths parents would go to protect their children. Set in Sweden, the novel takes readers on a suspenseful journey filled with moral dilemmas, secrets, and legal battles.

The story revolves around the Sandell family: Adam, a pastor, Ulrika, a criminal defense attorney, and their teenage daughter, Stella. The Sandells seem like an ordinary, well-functioning family until Stella is accused of a heinous crime—murdering a man much older than her. As the truth slowly unravels, the novel explores the perspectives of each family member, exposing their individual secrets and motivations.

One of the strengths of "A Nearly Normal Family" is the author's skill in creating a tense and immersive atmosphere. Edvardsson masterfully builds suspense, using multiple narrators and alternating timelines to provide different angles and keep readers guessing. The shifting perspectives not only give insight into the characters' thoughts and emotions but also challenge the readers' assumptions about guilt and innocence.

The character development in the novel is another highlight. Each family member is portrayed with depth and complexity, making them relatable and flawed. Adam, the father, is a sympathetic figure torn between his roles as a pastor and a protective parent. Ulrika, the mother, is determined to defend her daughter but must confront her own ethical boundaries as a lawyer. Stella's character is particularly intriguing, as her true nature remains elusive throughout the story, leaving readers questioning her innocence or guilt.

Furthermore, "A Nearly Normal Family" delves into themes of loyalty, trust, and the lengths people will go to protect their loved ones. The novel also examines the boundaries of the legal system and the question of whether justice can truly be achieved. It raises moral questions that linger with readers, provoking discussions about the nature of truth and the sacrifices one might make for family.

While the plot is engaging and full of twists, some readers may find certain sections slow-paced, as the focus shifts between the legal proceedings and the characters' personal lives. Additionally, the novel's conclusion may leave some readers wanting more closure or a clearer resolution to the moral dilemmas presented.

Overall, "A Nearly Normal Family" is a compelling and thought-provoking thriller that keeps readers captivated until the final page. M.T. Edvardsson crafts a complex and morally ambiguous narrative, exploring the dynamics of a seemingly ordinary family caught in extraordinary circumstances. Fans of psychological suspense and courtroom dramas will find this novel a worthwhile read.

This is easily one of my favorite books of all time and is the only book I’ve read three times in quick succession. Although I really enjoyed the audiobook version (read by Richard Armitage, George Maguire, and Emily Watson), I do sometimes regret not reading it. Had I read the book, I could have marked it up and taken notes in order to provide quotes and do a more thorough break down. However, the audiobook was so good that I have chosen to forgiven myself, and I would highly recommend that you look into the audio version as well.
