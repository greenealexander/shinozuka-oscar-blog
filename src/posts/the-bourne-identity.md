## Overall Review

Knowing nothing about the author, Robert Ludlum, and his reputation as a best-selling writer—selling over 200 million copies of his books worldwide, I decided to read this book because I’m a huge fan of the Jason Bourne movies (the first three) starring Matt Damon. I picked up this book assuming the storyline would be similar, if not identical to the movies, but after reading just the first few pages, I quickly realized that I was entering a much more intense experience.

If you are worried about picking up a copy for yourself because you’ve seen the movie like I was—don’t be. Robert Ludlum’s psychological spy thriller of an amnesiac on a journey into the unknown to reclaim his life opened doors of insight into the human mind that can’t be reproduced in its depth on screen. The internal and external chaos is masterfully balanced with a romantic element, both of which are completely different from the film. I highly recommend both the film and the book, but if you want a deeper and more complex storyline, I suggest you read this book.
