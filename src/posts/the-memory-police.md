## Overall Review

I had high expectations going into this book since it was named a finalist for the 2019 National Book Award for Translated Literature, shortlisted for the 2020 International Booker Prize, and a finalist for the 2020 World Fantasy Award. At first, this book reminded me of Misery by Stephen King, one of my favorite books I’ve ever read, because, in both novels, the main protagonists are authors who write their own novels, which are cleverly included as chapters in the actual books. But, that was the only similarity between the two books. Unlike Misery’s heavily character-driven and suspenseful plot, which kept me engrossed until the very end, The Memory Police lacked both plot and character development, leaving me feeling disappointed—at first. 

The Memory Police has a coherent storyline, but it is fragmented, with little transitions between scenes/chapters, and the story’s meaning is still unclear to me. As an avid reader of the mystery and suspense genres, where there is always a clear plot, and by the end, everything is thoroughly explained, leaving me feeling satisfied, this book was the polar opposite, making it increasingly difficult for me to grasp its purpose and meaning. 

On the other hand, although I didn’t really enjoy the book while I was reading it, after looking online to hear/read other people’s opinions and thoughts on the story, I realized that each person’s thoughts and perspectives were vastly different—including my own—encouraging me to attempt my own analysis. This surprisingly increased my enjoyment of the book. It’s not often that I read a book that provokes so many questions, making discussions about the book so much easier—and more interesting. 

Overall, if your the type of person that prefers a subtle book that requires you to reflect and interpret its meaning, I think that you’ll find this book to be one of the best. Despite its open-ended conclusion with no resolution, which was off-putting at first, I would still encourage you to branch out and read books like these once in a while. Through my own analysis, I’ve discovered that the true magic of this book is found in its multiple meanings and messages which I hope to relay my interpretations in the following sections.

## Importance of Creation: Creating More Than Is Lost

#### Japan's Creation Myth: Izanagi and Izanami

>“What can the people on this island create?“ I went on. “A few kinds of vegetables, cars that constantly break down, heavy, bulky stoves, some half-starved stock animals, oily cosmetics, babies, the occasional simple play, books no one reads... Poor, unreliable things that will never make up for those that are disappearing—and the energy that goes along with them. It’s subtle but it seems to be speeding up, and we have to watch out. If it goes on like this and we can’t compensate for the things that get lost, the island will soon be nothing but absences and holes, and when it’s completely hollowed out, we will all disappear without a trace. Don’t you ever feel that way?”
— The Memory Police, pg. 52-53

When I read the excerpt above, it reminded me of the story of Izanagi and Izanami from the Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters), a sacred text of the Shinto religion compiled from oral tradition in 712 which is one of the first written texts in Japan’s recorded history. “It includes myths, legends, and historical accounts of the imperial court from the earliest days of its creation up to the reign of Empress Suiko (628). Much of Shinto thought is based on interpretations of the mythology contained in the Kojiki” (Britannica). Below is an excerpt from the story of Izanagi and Izanami found in the Kojiki translated by Gustav Heldt (the version I own):

>As they stood there with the boulder between them, they declared themselves divorced. The mighty one She Who Beckoned spoke first, saying:
”Beloved brother, my mighty one, if you do this, I will strangle to death one thousand of your green-grass mortals each and everyday.”
And so the mighty one He Who Beckoned replied, proclaiming:
Sweet sister, my mighty one, if you do this, I will build one thousand five hundred birthing huts each and every day.”
This is why each and every day one thousand people die, while one thousand five hundred people are born.”
— Kojiki, pg. 16

Both the excerpt from The Memory Police and the Kojiki illustrate the inevitability of loss and the importance of creating more than is lost to continue existing. What makes a great book is how relevant it is over time, something Yoko Ogawa accomplished brilliantly with The Memory Police. Despite its original date of publishing in 1994, it was recently translated into English in 2019, which is why many people, including myself, thought this was a relatively new book, especially because its themes seem more relevant than ever in modern-day Japan—and perhaps the rest of the world. 

This idea of creating more than is lost brings to mind some popular issues in Japan such as the aging population and low birth-rate issue, which is also related to the decreasing working-age population issue, the self-sustainable energy issue, and also the issue involving the preservation of Japanese culture in Japan itself. To give you an idea of what I’m talking about, I’ve listed some statistics below:

 >- According to PRB, Japan currently has the oldest population, with 35.58 million people over 65, 28.2% of the total population, or about 1 in 4 people. Italy is second, with 22.8% of its population being over 65.
>- Finland, Portugal, and Greece round out the top five at just under 22 percent.
>- Southern Europe, which includes such countries Croatia, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia and Spain, is the oldest region in the world with 21 percent of the population ages 65+.
>- Twelve percent of China’s population is age 65 or above. That share is 16 percent in the United States, 6 percent in India, and 3 percent in Nigeria.”
— PRB

>- According to Statista, Japan’s self-sufficiency rate of primary energy in 2018 was 11.8%. After, the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, the self-sufficiency rate had dropped to 6.7% and has started to rise since the reactivation of the nuclear power plant—but is obviously extremely low.

>- According to FRED https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LFWA64TTJPM647S, the working-age population was around 87 million in the mid-1990s but has continued to fall from that point to around 74 million at present.

## What Is Worth Saving? Is Existing Enough?

#### Saving Japanese History and Culture

>“What lovely roses,“ I told her. Anything I had ever felt about these flowers had already vanished from my heart, but she was plucking the petals from her own blooms with such tenderness that I wanted to say something to her. This was the first thing that came to mind.
>“Thank you. They won the gold medal at last year‘s fair, you know.“ My comment seemed to have pleased her. “They are the last and most beautiful memento I have of my late father.“ But there is no regret in her voice as she tore apart the pedals and sent them fluttering into the water. The polish on her fingernails was nearly the same shade as the flowers. Once her work was done, she turned and, without a glance at the stream, gave me the sort of graceful bow typical of people of her class and left.”
— The Memory Police, pg. 50

There are two ways that I’ve interpreted the above excerpt. One—that memory is more valuable than the physical object, and two—people have no regret throwing away their own heritage.

>“As I watched the ashes, it occurred to me that the disappearances were perhaps not as important as the memory police wanted us to believe. Most things would disappear like this when set on fire, and they could be blown away on the wind with very little regard for what they once might have been.”
— The Memory Police, pg. 133

#### Existing vs. Living

>But he never read a single page of any of my books. Once, when I told him I love to know what he thinks of them, he demurred. “I couldn’t possibly say,“ he said. “If you read a novel to the end, then it’s over. I would never want to do something as wasteful as that. I’d much rather keep it here with me, safe and sound, forever.
— The Memory Police, pg. 17

>The old man observes that, for most inhabitants, preserving something in memory will be “wasteful” because the mind is the space of greatest vulnerability, and has no natural armour. Therefore they must safeguard the calendars, maps and other objects themselves. Bereft of memories, words and associations, the inhabitants know that their hearts are growing “thinner”. The soul – personhood, selfhood – is hollowed out.
— Madeleine Thien, The Guardian

The idea of existence was a bit strange in this book. For example, early on in the book, birds disappear, but the word disappear is used in a slightly different context. The memories of birds disappear, but the birds themselves do not. Thankfully, this distinction is provided at the very beginning of the book, so you don’t have to worry about much confusion. For most citizens of the community—excluding the very few who were able to maintain their memories—the things that disappeared lost their value and were disposed of under the watch of the Memory Police. 

This brought up an interesting question to my mind: what defines existence? For example, Conan Doyle is known to have existed because of his beloved sherlock holmes novels and short stories, but for someone like myself, despite being alive at present, I am not known and therefore, I do not exist in the minds of many. I am like the birds and the many other things that disappear throughout the novel. I exist in the world, but at the same time, I don’t. 

This reminded me of the Greek word kleos, often translated as "renown" or "glory." It is related to the English word "loud" and carries the implied meaning of "what others hear about you.” A Greek hero earns kleos through accomplishing great deeds (Wikipedia). Men would long for battle willing to throw away their lives for glory, so they could leave their mark on history and live on in memory as legends.

## Who Gets to Decide? 

>"Our primary function here is to assure that there are no delays in the process and that useless memories disappear quickly and easily. I’m sure you’d agree that there is no point in holding onto them. If your big toe becomes infected with gangrene, you cut it off as soon as you can. If you do nothing, you end up losing the whole leg. The principle is the same. The only difference is that you can’t touch or see memories, or get inside the hearts they’re kept in. Each one of us hides them away in secret. So, since our adversary is invisible, we are forced to use our intuition. It is extremely delicate work. In order to unmask these invisible secrets, to analyze and sort and dispose of them, we must work in secret, to protect ourselves. I think you can understand."
— The Memory Police, pg. 106

Jordan Peterson delivered this lecture at the North York Civic Centre Council Chambers on January 22, 2017 on the subject "Freedom of Speech or Political Cor...

“It’s left to the reader to ask the questions. Who are the Memory Police, with their fine uniforms and empty faces? To whom do they report, and how did they come to hold such absolute power? How is it that all the fruit disappears, or that the snow never melts – that nature itself submits? Are we the Memory Police as well as the ones without memory?”
— Madeleine Thien, The Guardian

## Voices

Why were voices the last to disappear? yet in her novel, the voice was the first thing to disappear. the voice was free-flowing and able to go anywhere sneaking through the cracks between doorways unable to be contained. However, like the voices, their meaning escapes me.

“The thing I found most surprising,” I said, taking up the story, “was that overtime as servants who did this work lost the power of speech. After many long days, dawn to dusk, rubbing their clothes in the stone room, they actually became mute. They had no fear of clouding the silver with her words, or for even after they finished work and left the room, they could no longer recall the sound of their own voices. But these were poor, uneducated people who were unlikely to find work elsewhere, so they continued polishing year after year, willing to sacrifice their voices for a steady income. And the room became quieter and quieter as one after another lost the power of speech, with nothing to be heard but the muffled sound of cloth on silver. But I wonder how it got to that point.”
— The Memory Police, pg. 122
The main protagonist in the book and the character that she writes about in her own novel live contrasting lives. The main protagonist loses her voice last and harbors a man in her basement while her fictional character is mute and is held captive in the clock tower.

#### Fear

>“Hurry now! If you aren’t quick she’ll go away!
In my head I scream these words to myself. But something held me back.
No! Keep still! How can you explain this to her? Would she believe you? And how would you even tell her? It’s not just words you like. Your eyes and ears, every part of your body has been deformed to fit this room—that is, to fit his purposes. And even if she did help you, do you really believe you’d get back all the things you’ve lost.”
— The Memory Police, pg. 262

It’s funny because, in this instance, I personally think that instead of caring about what she’d lost, she should be thinking more about the future and the things that she would gain that in all honesty would probably benefit her more than recovering the things that she’d lost. This conclusion is the exact opposite of the reasoning I came to after reading about the main protagonist who struggled to keep her memories of the past that were linked to her identity.
