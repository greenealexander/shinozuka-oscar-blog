I havent read the book, and after reading this, I definitely won't be reading picking up a copy any time soon. I only bought this book, The 50th Law, because I am a fan of 50 Cent.

## Overall Review

I knew of author Robert Greene from his New York Times bestseller <i>The 48 Laws of Power</i>. I havent read the book, and after reading this, I definitely won't be reading picking up a copy any time soon. I only bought this book, <i>The 50th Law</i>, because I am a fan of 50 Cent. I assumed that this was going to be something like a memoir of 50 Cent's life with an analytical look at how he gained power and how he uses it. 

Unfortunately, the book barely touched on 50's life, and frequently used examples of other people that I wasn't inerested in reading about, though granted they were well known leaders of the past like Napolean Bonaparte. The short refernces to 50's life that were included in the book, which were scarce, were irritatingly repeated over and over again. 

A more useful way to describe this book would be a list of motivational quotes and advice. I listed quotes and exceprts from the book that I found most profound, but there wasn't much else that I liked about the book.

## Quotes That Resonated With Me

>The greatest danger we face, he told Curtis, is not the police or some nasty rival. It's the mind going soft. I've seen it happen to many a hustler, he said. If things go well, he starts thinking it will go on forever and he takes his eyes off the streets. If things go bad, he starts wishing it were all different and he comes up with some foolish scheme to get quick, easy money. Either waay, he falls fast. Lose your grip on reality on these streets and you might as well kill yourself.
<cite>Robert Greene, pg. 29</cite>

>Reality is my drug. The more I have of it, the more power I get and the higher I feel.
<cite>50 Cent, pg. 32</cite>

>If one is continually surviving the worst that life can bring, one eventually ceases to be controlled by a fear of what life can bring. — James Baldwin
, pg. 71

>Most people wait too long to go into action, generally out of fear. They want more money or better circumstances. You must go the opposite direction and move before you think you are ready. It is as if you are making it a little more difficult for yourself, deliberately creating obstacles in your path. But it is a law of power that your energy will rise to the appropriate level. When you feel that you must work harder to get to your goal because you are not quite prepared, you are more alert and invented. This venture has to succeed and so it will.
Pg. 87

>The old musicians stay where they are and become like museum pieces under glass, safe, easy to understand, playing that tired old shit over and over again… The box was about change, about evolution. It wasn’t about standing still and becoming safe. If anybody wants to keep creating they have to be about change. 
– Miles Davis 
pg 93

>The way I learned it, the kid in the schoolyard who doesn’t want to fight always leaves with a blackeye. If you indicate you’ll do anything to avoid trouble, that’s when you get trouble. 
– 50 Cent
Pg 125

>For how we live is so far removed from how we ought to live , That he who abandons what is done for what ought to be done, will rather learn to bring about his own ruin than his preservation. A man who wishes to make a profession of goodness in everything must necessarily come to grief among so many who are not good. Therefore it is necessary for a prince, who wishes to maintain himself, learn how not to be good, and to use this knowledge and not use it, according to the necessity of the case. 
– Niccolo Machiavelli
Pg 132

>The greatest leaders in history all inevitably learn by experience the following lesson: it is much better to be feared and respected and to be loved.
Pg 159

>Master the instrument, master the music, then forget all that shit and play. 
– Charlie Parker
Pg 205

>Most people can’t handle boredom. That means they can’t stay on one thing until they get good at it. And they wonder why they’re unhappy. 
– 50 Cent
Pg 210

>People talk about my getting shot like it represented something special. They act like they’re not facing the same thing. But someday everybody has to face a bullet with his or her name on it. 
– 50 Cent
Pg 272
