## Overall Review

I wanted to continue expanding my awareness of Japanese authors, especially more recent authors. Up until now, I've focused more on older writers like Edogawa Ranpo, Natsume Soseki, Keigo Higashino, and Haruki Murakami. Since I've started reading books about Japan and translations of books by Japanese authors, I now get a lot of recommendations of books I should buy next on Amazon (where I usually by books). 

Books by Mieko Kawakami, the author of the internationally best-selling novel, <i> Breasts and Eggs. </i> She's also received numerous prestigious literary awards in Japan for her work, including the Akutagawa Prize, the Tanizaki Prize, and the Murasaki Shikibu Prize. This all is very impressive and so I decided that I would read one of her books, or so I thought... 

Instead, I made the mistake of buying <i>Strange Weather in Tokyo</i> by Hiromi Kawakami. I saw the name Kawakami and had mistaken one for the other. However, after I looked up Hiromi Kawakami I realized that she too is an outstanding author. She has won numerous Japanese literary awards, including the Akutagawa Prize, the Tanizaki Prize, the Yomiuri Prize, and the Izumi Kyōka Prize for Literature. Her work has been adapted for film, and has been translated into more than 15 languages. So in the end, not a complete blunder on my part to have bought her book.

Unfortunately, I wasn’t a big fan of the book. It was boring. Plain and simple. It was the first book in a while that I haven’t marked up with post-its as I usually do. It was also the first book where I fell asleep in public while reading. I usually read while I’m on the train or at the beach or at the local AEON Mall that is close by to make sure that I keep my focus. For some reason, I find myself in a more focused state while in public, though after reading Atomic Habits (the last book I read), I have a good idea of why this happens. 

I live in a one-room apartment, so my subconscious mind probably starts going into sleep mode as soon as I enter my room since that’s where I sleep every night. Going to a place where there are no subconscious cues to make me sleepy is the main reason why I started reading out in public in the first place. Despite this, I fell asleep on numerous occasions, which has never happened before. 

I just didn’t find the book captivating at all nor did I connect with the characters. The dialogue was too simple which only made it more boring. I’m just glad it was a short book, so I can move on to the next one.
