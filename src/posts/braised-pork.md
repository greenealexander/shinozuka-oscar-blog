## Overall Review

Honestly the trippiest book that I've ever read, second only to <i>Kafka on the Shore</i> by Haruki Murakami, but I liked this book much more. I don't usually read books like this one, mainly sticking to crime fiction which contain zero magical/fantastical elements. I was pleasantly surprisinged with how much I enjoyed reading Braised Pork, especially since I had been put-off from reading books classified as "magical realism" or "fantasy" after reading Kafka on the Shore.
