## Overall Review

I’ve read a good amount of mysteries until now, but they’ve mostly consisted of the classics by Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie and books by Japanese authors like Edogawa Ranpo and Higashino Keigo. Other authors include Gillian Flynn (Gone Girl), Stephen King (Mr. Mercedes), M. T. Edvardsson (A Nearly Normal Family), and some others that I can’t remember off the top of my head. I’m also a fan of Detective Conan, which is the bulk of my mystery/crime fiction experience—comprised of over a thousand episodes and almost thirty movies.

Lately, I’ve really tried to open my mind to other authors that aren’t mainstream because I believe that something can be gained from reading their work. I’ve learned what I like from the classics and critically acclaimed works above, and I’ve started to understand the things I dislike after reading Murder On Bamboo Lane. This was the first time reading a cozy mystery, and I can firmly say that I am not a fan.

In addition to an absence of a single unlikeable, the lack of complexity in the plot made the story feel very one-dimensional and frankly boring, causing me to put the book down on multiple occasions. I liked this book more than Snakeskin Shamisen because there was some character development involving the protagonist, Ellie Rush is a young up-and-coming bike cop trying to make a difference in her community, while Mas Arai, the protagonist in Snakeskin Shamisen is a seventy-two-year-old man who was set in his ways and risk-averse. Watching her overcome her many obstacles—friends distancing themselves from her because she’s a cop, office politics, a tough breakup, and family troubles—in the end, got me through the book.

I usually litter my books with little stickies to mark important passages or sentences that I may want to include in my review and/or parts of the book that I would like to try and emulate in my own writing. Unfortunately, after reading Murder On Bamboo Lane and Snakeskin Shamisen, for the first time, I found myself not marking up the books nearly as much—marking passages in Murder On Bamboo Lane just four times.

I consider myself lucky to have stumbled upon these two books by Naomi Hirahara because I found myself doing exactly what I disliked about them. Just as I’ve mentioned above, I hadn’t created any characters that were unlikeable in the least in the current short story I’m writing. I had spent all of my time focusing on the depth of the main protagonist that I neglected pretty much every other character as well as some aspects of story. I’ve definitely learned some useful things, but I don’t see myself picking up a cozy mystery for a while…
