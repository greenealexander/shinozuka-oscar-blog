description: I usually litter my books with little stickies to mark important passages or sentences that I may want to include in my review and/or parts of the book that I would like to try and emulate in my own writing. Unfortunately, after reading Murder On Bamboo Lane and Snakeskin Shamisen, for the first time, I found myself not marking up the books nearly as much—marking passages in Murder On Bamboo Lane just four times.

## Overall Review

Lately, I’ve really tried to open my mind to other authors that aren’t mainstream because I believe that something can be gained from reading their work. I’ve learned what I like from the classics and critically acclaimed works above, and I’ve started to understand the things I dislike after reading "Murder On Bamboo Lane." This was the first time reading a cozy mystery, and I can firmly say that I am not a fan.

"Murder on Bamboo Lane" is the first book in the Officer Ellie Rush Mystery series written by Naomi Hirahara. The novel introduces us to Ellie Rush, a young, ambitious, and determined bicycle cop in the Los Angeles Police Department.

Set in the diverse and vibrant city of Los Angeles, "Murder on Bamboo Lane" delves into the life of Ellie Rush as she navigates her way through a puzzling murder case. When a college student is found dead in an abandoned building, Ellie becomes personally invested in solving the crime due to her connections to the victim's family. As she delves deeper into the investigation, Ellie uncovers a complex web of secrets, suspects, and hidden motivations.

One of the strengths of this novel is the author's ability to bring the setting to life. Hirahara's descriptions of Los Angeles capture the multicultural essence of the city, showcasing its neighborhoods and cultural diversity. The book also explores Ellie's multicultural background and her experiences as a biracial woman, adding depth to her character and shedding light on the complexities of identity.

Hirahara's writing style is engaging and immersive, allowing readers to become fully engrossed in the story. The pacing is well-balanced, keeping the suspense and intrigue high throughout the narrative. The author weaves together multiple plot threads, introducing various suspects and red herrings, keeping readers guessing until the final reveal.

Moreover, "Murder on Bamboo Lane" touches on relevant social issues, such as immigration, race relations, and the challenges faced by minority communities. Hirahara incorporates these themes organically into the story, adding depth and relevance to the overall narrative.

However, some readers may find the mystery itself to be relatively predictable or less intricate compared to other crime novels. The lack of complexity in the plot made the story feel very one-dimensional and frankly boring, causing me to put the book down on multiple occasions. While the book does a commendable job of exploring social issues and character development, the mystery plot itself may not offer as many surprising twists and turns as some readers might expect.
