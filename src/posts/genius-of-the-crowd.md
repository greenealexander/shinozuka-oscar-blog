## Discovering Charles Bukowski: Learning to Appreciate Poetry
Until more recently, I had never been a lover of poetry, some too short, some too long, and some too hard to understand. To me poetry was something for the prententious and snobby, and not smoething that was worth reading. But as I sat, alone with thoughts, in my tiny twenty square meter apartment in west Kobe, I began contemplating the validity of my life choices. 

I had just moved to Kobe after coming to the conclusion that living in an old, small, and moldy house shared with seven other Japanese people—having to share my room with two of them leaving me with no room for much needed personal space—was not a healthy environment. 

It was my first time living with Japanese people. I had spent my entire life in The United States, and so I wasn't sure what to expect. This isn't to say that I had zero expectations for what was to come. While I was in America, plotting my escape to Japan, which I envisioned as paradise, I did what ever I could to make myself feel as if I were living in Japan, which consisted of me binge watching "Terrace House," a show about six regualr Japanese people—three men and three women—who live together in a nice house located somewhere in Japan (the location changed each season). 

The show was my escape from my mundane college life in America, and it was from watching this series that I developed some unrealistic expectations of what living with Japanese people in a share house would be like. In contrast to the cheery, good-looking, and ambitious people that appear in "Terrace House," the people that I lived with were pretty much the exact opposite. Not to mention that I would end up living in a dreadful little house that smelled of mold, especially the shower room which was literally covered in it. I remember having to hold my breath as I took quick showers to avoid inhaling the mold particles. 

Living with people that have no ambition, who would come home from a long days work and complain about the same thing as the previous day, who also wouldn't make any effort to try to get to know me or each other, was exceptionally depressing. Inevitably, the negativity began to affect my creativity, as well as, my own mental state of being. Although, since the place was only about $200 a month, which included utilities, free rice, laundry detergent, and more, I'm not sure why I expected the experience to be better.

Finally, after about 8 months of living in that share house, located in Saitama prefecture, I took a night-bus to Kansai—the western region of Japan. It was during this time of experiencing being truly alone for the first time that I had my first experience with Charles Bukowski. 

For some reason, YouTube had suggested it to me. I didn’t know who he was or what the video was about, but I happened to click on it anyway because the title was intriguing. I would then end up falling in love with this poem and go on to read Ham On Rye (1982), a semi-autobiographical novel of Charles Bukowski that follows his alter-ego Henry Chinaski—which I also loved.

## Beware the Preachers
I preached happiness to my friends, to family, and even to strangers I’d just met, but I didn’t have it:

“Beware the preachers
Beware the knowers
Beware those who are always reading books
Beware those who either detest poverty
Or are proud of it
Beware those quick to praise
For they need praise in return
Beware those who are quick to censor
They are afraid of what they do not know”
— Charles Bukowski, Genius of the Crowd

He uses the word average four times and suddenly uses the word genius. The contrast… This is my favorite part of the poem and it never ceases to send a chill down my spine. 

>Beware the average man the average woman
Beware their love, their love is average
Seeks average
But there is genius in their hatred
There is enough genius in their hatred to kill you
To kill anybody
— Charles Bukowski, Genius of the Crowd

>“Do you want to be right? Or do you want to be learning? And it’s deeper than that, do you want to be the tyrannical king who’s already got everything figured out? Or do you want to be the continually transforming hero?; or fool for that matter, who’s getting better all the time. And that’s actually a choice. It’s a deep choice. And it’s better to be the self-transforming fool who’s humble enough to make friends with what he or she doesn’t know and to listen when people talk.”
— Jordan B. Peterson, "Jordan B. Peterson on 12 Rules for Life," 1:06:40

Beware the average man the average woman. Beware their love. Their love is average. Seeks average.  But there is genius in their hatred. There is enough hatred in their love to kill you. To kill anybody.

## The Crowd Mentality: The Zebra Story and Human Motivation

I came across a video of Jordan Peterson where he explains human motivation.
