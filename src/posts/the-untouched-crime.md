### Overall Review

This is the first time that I’ve read a book by a Chinese author, though I obviously read the version translated into English. It was honestly a shot in the dark. I had zero expectations going into this book, but following the same thought process that led me to find <i>The Guest List</i>, I somehow ended up with <i>The Untouched Crime</i> on my bookshelf. 

It quickly reminded me of <i>The Devotion to Suspect X</i> by Keigo Higashino—one of my favorite books I’ve ever read. Both books are about two people that unintentionally commit murder and are saved when a bystander helps them cover it up. I preferred Keigo Higashino’s book far more because there was deeper psychological reasoning behind each character's actions. And there was more introspection where I, as the reader, developed a deeper connection with the story's main players. 

Although I have this unconscious baseline level of psychological conflict that I desire, whether it's a crime fiction that focuses hevaily on logic or not, reading <i>The Untouched Crime</i> after reading <i>The Guest List</i> and <i>The Girl Who Played with Fire</i> was a blessing in disguise. Reading two very psychological books back to back, and perhaps a few more before them as well, was more mentally taxing than I had anticipated. So, reading a simpler book that still had some good twists and turns thoroughly satisfied me to the point that I almost gave this book a higher rating than I should have, which I only realized as I was in the process of writing this review. Nonetheless, I still really enjoyed reading Zijin Chen’s book. The way that the murder is covered up is nothing short of genius, though I think it was revealed way to early, thus robbing readers like me of the suspense that I hunger for.
