## Materials I used to Study Japanese

For those who are mostly interested in knowing the specific materials I used to learn Japanese I have listed them below. Just be aware that prior to beginning my Japanese learning journey, I had unconsciously absorbed more Japanese than I had realized during my childhood. 

Being half Japanese, I had many opportunities to go to Japan to visit my Japanese relatives. These trips that would allow me to stay in Japan for months at a time and my love for watching anime in its orignal Japanese version enabled me to absorbed quite a bit of vocabulary and grammar. This put me way ahead of the typical person who would start from zero. I was already able to understand spoken Japanese, but I was unable to produce the language myself. Keep this in mind and good luck!

#### Materials in the Order That I used Them

## Reading Books In Your Target Language: Why You Should Skip Textbooks

Reading books in your target language offers several benefits compared to reading language textbooks:

1. Authentic Language Use: Books provide authentic language use in a variety of contexts. They offer a glimpse into the culture, idiomatic expressions, and real-life situations of native speakers. This exposure to authentic language helps improve comprehension, vocabulary, and overall language fluency.

2. Language Patterns and Style: Books showcase the natural flow and style of the language. They present different sentence structures, grammar patterns, and writing styles, allowing readers to internalize the language in a more organic way. This exposure enhances language proficiency beyond the rigid structures found in textbooks.

3. Vocabulary Expansion: Books offer a rich vocabulary repertoire that goes beyond what textbooks cover. By encountering words in their natural context, readers learn how words are used, their nuances, and appropriate collocations. This exposure to varied vocabulary enriches language skills and helps build a more nuanced understanding of the language.

4. Cultural Insights: Books provide a window into the culture, history, and social aspects of the target language. Through stories, novels, and non-fiction, readers gain insights into the values, traditions, and perspectives of the people who speak the language. This cultural understanding adds depth and authenticity to language learning.

5. Improved Reading Skills: Reading books in the target language strengthens reading comprehension skills. It trains learners to navigate longer texts, follow complex storylines, and infer meaning from context. These skills transfer to other areas of language learning, such as listening comprehension and writing.

6. Enjoyment and Motivation: Reading books in the target language can be an enjoyable and engaging experience. It allows learners to immerse themselves in captivating stories, intriguing plots, and diverse characters. This enjoyment fosters motivation and a positive attitude towards language learning, which can lead to increased perseverance and progress.

While language textbooks are valuable resources for learning grammar rules and vocabulary basics, reading books offers a more immersive and holistic language learning experience. It provides exposure to authentic language use, cultural insights, and an enjoyable means of expanding language skills. Combining both approaches can lead to a well-rounded and effective language learning journey.

## University: My First Japanese Class

As someone who didn't like to study on my own at the time, I found it extremely useful to be in a class, especially at the beginning of my journey. Having a teacher guide me through textbook material in class was particularly valuable to me as there was zero chance that I would have read through the textbook on my own. 

My Japanese language study at University lasted just two and a half years; one year of elemenatary Japanese, one year of intermediate Japanese, and half a year in an advanced level course. I found the first two years to be the most beneficial because was taught the necessary foundations of the Japanese, giving me a solid base to build on top of later on my own. This consisted of learning the two phonetic alphabets, hiragana and katakana, and hundreds of the basic kanji characters. 

However, since these courses mainly focused on reading and writing, I couldn't speak Japanese very well, or hardly at all to be frank. The advanced course was taught in Japanese, and met only once a week for fifty minutes. Compared to the beginner and intermediate courses that met four times a week for about an hour each, the advanced course didn't allow for much practice and really annoyed me. In retrospect, it wasn't all bad, since it definitely motivated me to learn on my own.

## Moving to Japan 

### Big Decision: Forcing Myself to Learn

Something I realized while in University was that I progress much faster when I force myself to do something; give myself no other choice. The only reason I attended Japanese class was because I had to graduate. And since I didn't enjoy studying; reading directly from a textbook, I did the bare minimum. To me, this meant that in order to increase the rate of my learning I had to raise the bare minimum standard. So, I chose to move to Japan under the condition that I don't work as an English Teacher. 

I would have to use Japanese in every aspect of life whether I wanted to or not - including talking to a realtor to find a place to rent, securing health insurance, paying taxes, and of course finding a job. As you can imagine, my Japanese speaking and reading abilities skyrocketed. 

I need to provide some further context. I am a Japanese citizen, so I didn't need to get a visa, or anything of the sort, to move to and live in Japan. This made things super easy to figure out, and I experienced very few issues with landlords, and securing health insurance, etc. 

### Living In A Share House

The only task I had before moving to Japan, besides booking the plane ticket, was finding a place to live. I decided to live in a share house. There were three main reasons for doing so: 
    1. Cheap rent 
        - About $200 USD per month
        - Fully furnished house
    2. I get to live with Japanese people
        - Easier to make new friends
        - Don't have to go out to practice Japanese
    3. No two year commitment (could leave with one month's notice)

### Getting A Job

I also didn't get a job before arriving in Japan. I wrote a resume in Japanese and went to the unemployment office nearest to where I lived and applied for various part-time jobs. It only took a few days to get a job at a gyoza restaurant, but I quit after three days, because I was so stressed out. I don't think that I did a terrible job, it was very fast paced considering my Japanese level at the time. I even had a couple customers wave me away as they grumbled to themselves.

After this I spent a good year and a half reading Japanese manga and novels in their original Japanese version of course. One of the benefits of living in Japan is that it's easy to find and buy Japanese books for very cheap, especially if you buy them used like I did. I used a Japanese to English dictionary app on my phone to translate the words that I didn't understand. I prefer this style of learning compared to reading a textbook, because it doesn't feel like I'm studying, and I could read at the appropriate level as well. 

I was living off of my savings for all that time, but eventually, I went broke and had to get a job. At this point though, my Japanese level had icreased dramatically, so I assumed that it wouln't take me long to get a job, but I was naive. Although I had greatly improved, I was still no where close to a native level speaker, and since I refused to do English Teaching, I had to compete with native level Japanese people for jobs. It took about six months to get a good job. Until then I worked jobs that didn't require much speaking, reading, or writing like; construction, vegetable packing, moving companies, etc. As I worked, I made time to set up interviews and luckily got hired at an unagi restaurant. I started off working there part-time, mainly as a dish washer. After two years, I became a full-time employee.
