## Lehigh University: My First Japanese Class

To be honest, I had very little interest in academics. Since I started playing soccer at eight years old, I never thought about anything else. My only goal was to play professionally in Japan. Though I also had plans to learn Japanese in the future, I assumed that it would take me at least ten years to be able to become fluent enough to work in Japan (I had no interest to work as an English Teacher), and so I thought that pursuing a profession in soccer, which wouldn't require me to speak Japanese, was my chance to recognize my dream of one day living in Japan. 

However, after graduating from high school at eighteen, I had no prospects of going pro. Though I did happen to get scouted to play for the Lehigh Univeristy Men's Soccer team, and so I reluctantly got on a plane to head back to America's Northeast to continue what I already considered a long career of schooling.

Although I probably should consider myself lucky to have gotten the opportunity to attend University, a good one too, I had no idea what I would study. However, to my delight, as I was browsing the courses available to me, I realized that they offered Japanese classes and that one could also major in Japanese Language. Naturally I enrolled in the Japanese Beginner course and started my Japanese Language journey.

Too my disappointment however, the beginner level and intermediate level courses (a total of four courses in two years, two beginner and two intermediate) were too easy for me, which was also a pleasant surprise. I hadn't realized that my past experiences vacationing in Japan, as well as, over a decade of watching Crayon Shinchan and Detective Conan, among other anime series, in their original Japanese verion had taught me so much.  

Despite the level being too low and the pace of the courses being to slow, I still consider these classes to have been very beneficial to me. It was a great way to discover my own level of competence, including my strengths and weaknesses, and it allowed me to build a foundation of knowledge to build upon as I continued my studies on my own in the future. 

As someone who didn't like to study on my own at the time, I found it extremely useful to be in a class, especially at the beginning of my journey. Having a teacher guide me through the textbook material in class was particularly vauable to me as there was zero chance that I would have read through the textbook on my own. 

In my two and a half years of Japanese language study in University, which in addition to the beginner and intermediate courses also included one advanced course, I learned the two phonetic Japanese alphabets - hiragana and katakana - and about a thousand kanji and most of the basic grammar. However, since these courses mainly focused on reading and writing, I couldn't speak Japanese very well. The advanced course was taught in Japanese, which in my opinion made it much harder to learn, and was only once a week for fifty minutes. Compared to the beginner and intermediate courses that met four times a week for about an hour each, the advanced course didn't allow for much practice and really annoyed me. 

I didn't end up doing well in the advanced class - according to my grades. Although my test scores were good, I hadn't done a single homework assignment, which I didn't realize at the time was twenty percent of my grade, and I half-assed my presentations, which left me with a D-. This meant that I couldn't take the next advanced course which required a C- or higher. To be honest, I glad that this happened because it motivated me to study on my own, at my own pace, using the study materials I wanted to use, all of which allowed me to progress much faster. Though I would end up putting off my studies for another two years until I graduated from University.

## Moving to Japan: Living in a Share House 

After I graduated from Lehigh University in the summer of 2019, I immediately moved to Japan once I received my diploma.
