### Overall Review

Continuing with my exploration of Japanese authors, I read <i>A Man</i> by Keiichiro Hirano, winner of Japan’s prestigious Yomiuri Prize for Literature. This book was his first book to be translated into English, and I was super excited to read this book after reading its synopsis on Goodreads (which I've included below), but I felt that it didn't live up to its potential. 

>Akira Kido is a divorce attorney whose own marriage is in danger of being destroyed by emotional disconnect. With a midlife crisis looming, Kido’s life is upended by the reemergence of a former client, Rié Takemoto. She wants Kido to investigate a dead man—her recently deceased husband, Daisuké. Upon his death she discovered that he’d been living a lie. His name, his past, his entire identity belonged to someone else, a total stranger. The investigation draws Kido into two intriguing mysteries: finding out who Rié’s husband really was and discovering more about the man he pretended to be. Soon, with each new revelation, Kido will come to share the obsession with—and the lure of—erasing one life to create a new one.

The beginning of Kido's investigation was dull and dreary. He had questioned several people related to the man who's identity was stolen by Rie's husband—his brother, an ex-girlfriend, and a few others—but had little luck finding any real hints to "X's" true identity. Until Kido started to make progress in his investigation, most of the first half of the book focused more on Kido's background as a third-genertation Zainichi born and raised in Kanazawa, Japan and his failing marriage.

##### Definition of Zainichi For Those Who Are Unfamiliar

>Koreans in Japan are commonly called “Zainichi.” In a broad definition, the term covers Koreans who came to Japan before the Japanese colonial era, Koreans who moved to Japan during the colonial period and their descendants, and Koreans who chose to move to Japan, mostly after 1965 when South Korea and Japan established diplomatic relations. However, the term usually refers to those who came over to Japan during its colonial rule over Korea, and their descendants.

Kido being a third-generation Zainichi is an important part of his identity and one of the main reasons he starts to fancy the idea of being able to disappear or swap his identiy with another. Kido's fear of telling people about his Korean roots due to remaining tensions between Japan was something I personally had a hard time relating to. 

 The book was jumpstarted when Kido finally discovered a clue that led to a meeting with Omiura, a prisoner in Yokohama Prison. 

"Kido's Zainichi background allowed him to imagine and relate to the many circumstances that might force people to hide their identity" (Hirano, pg. 175)

### Interesting Points About the Japanese Registry System

>It’s introduction dated back to the era of the Ritsuryo system, an imperial bureaucracy modeled after China’s that began in the late sixth century. Used mainly in the beginning for policing and tax collection, the family registry was expanded over a millennium later in the Edo period when it became a tool for cracking down on Christianity. Records of religious affiliation were drawn up to Check who was registered with Buddhist temples, and a wider range of information was incorporated for individual identity management, including birth, marriage, adoption, current address, job, and death. From then on they were always numerous people such as vagrants who were not accounted for in the records. <br><br> As this system presupposed attachment to land, it was rendered obsolete in the late 19th century, not long after the start of the Meiji period, when freedom of movement was recognized, and the first modern family register was introduced. This new family register was employed in the census for purposes of conscription and tax collection, and the desire to avoid these led many to ditch or falsify their registers. 
<cite> Keiichiro Hirano, Pg. 125</cite>

>As per the civil code, a child born within 300 days of a divorce was legally considered to be the child of the former husband. The law had become controversial as of late because women, who, for example, divorced after suffering domestic violence and who had a child soon after with a new partner, sometimes refrain from submitting a notification of birth. This left some children to enter society without a family register.

### My Favorite Part of the Book
####Late Night Train Home: Beer, Sweat, and Squid

Though I wasn't a huge fan of the plot, the book was very well written. My favorite part of the book was a description of what being on a late night train home. After living and wirking in Japan for a couple years now, I thought that Keiichiro Hirano nailed the imagery of the commute home after a long day of work.

>Now, riding the final Nozomi back to Tokyo that night, Kido gazed from his window and zoned out on the passing scenery. The interior of the bullet train had looked somehow grotesque under the weight of his exhaustion and the sharp fluorescent lights. While many passengers dozed, several drunken groups chattered incessantly. The air in the car was stagnant and heavy, laced with the stench of workday sweat, beer, and some pungent junk food, perhaps dried squid. Kido's suit was tinged with the added scent of incense he had burned for his friend.
