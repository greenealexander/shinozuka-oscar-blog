### Overall Review

>Now, riding the final Nozomi back to Tokyo that night, Kido gazed from his window and zoned out on the passing scenery. The interior of the bullet train had looked somehow grotesque under the weight of his exhaustion and the sharp fluorescent lights. While many passengers dozed, several drunken groups chattered incessantly. The air in the car awas stagnant and heavy, laced with the stench of workday sweat, beer, and some pungent junk food, perhaps dried squid. Kido's suit was tinged with the added scent of incense he had burned for his friend.

>It’s introduction dated back to the era of the Ritsuryo system, an imperial bureaucracy modeled after China’s that began in the late sixth century. Used mainly in the beginning for policing and tax collection, the family registry was expanded over a millennium later in the Edo period when it became a tool for cracking down on Christianity. Records of religious affiliation were drawn up to Check who was registered with Buddhist temples, and a wider range of information was incorporated for individual identity management, including birth, marriage, adoption, current address, job, and death. From then on they were always numerous people such as vagrants who were not accounted for in the records. <br> As this system presupposed attachment to land, it was rendered obsolete in the late 19th century, not long after the start of the Meiji period, when freedom of movement was recognized, and the first modern family register was introduced. This new family register was employed in the census for purposes of conscription and tax collection, and the desire to avoid these led many to ditch or falsify their registers.

>As per the civil code, a child born within 300 days of a divorce was legally considered to be the child of the former husband. The law had become controversial as of late because women, who, for example, divorced after suffering domestic violence and who had a child soon after with a new partner, sometimes refrain from submitting a notification of birth. This left some children to enter society without a family register.
