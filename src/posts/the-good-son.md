## Quick Review

"The Good Son" by You-Jeong Jeong is a psychological thriller that takes readers on a chilling journey into the depths of a troubled mind. With its dark atmosphere and suspense, this novel will leave you questioning the nature of good and evil.

The pacing is steady, with the tension gradually building as the layers of Yu-jin's past are peeled away. The author cleverly weaves together the present-day investigation, done by Yu-jin, with chilling flashbacks, gradually revealing shocking secrets and adding depth to the overall narrative. 

Unlike other thrillers that have a plethorah of characters and multiple points of view, The Good Son is centered around a single character. Because of this I definitely felt that the story was not as complex, though conversely, it didn't lack depth. While the novel keeps readers engaged throughout, there are moments when the pacing slows down, and certain plot twists may feel slightly predictable to seasoned thriller readers.

## Creepy Fetish: What Attracted Me To The Main Character Yu-jin?

The slow pacing in the first half of the book prevented me from being able to dive in. It wasn't until the protagonist Yujin revealed that he had a creepy fetish that I was able to get into the story, I wonder what that says about me. However, once things started moving it was a great read with an unexpected ending that makes it worth reading until the end.

Yu-jin, is layered with psychological depth, as the author explores his struggles with identity, memory, and morality. 

Yu-jin suffers from a condition that causes memory lapses, making him an unreliable narrator. This adds an element of mystery and suspense to the story, as readers are constantly questioning what is real and what is distorted in his recollection of events. At times this made the story a bit confusing to read, but worth it. 
 
Throughout the novel, Yu-jin grapples with internal conflicts. He experiences guilt and confusion about his role in his mother's murder, while simultaneously seeking the truth behind his own actions. His struggles with memory gaps leave him susceptible to manipulation and further blur the lines between reality and fiction. 

As he unravels the layers of his past confronting his own dark secrets, he begins to understand himself 

Philosophically, it brings up the question of; how well can people understand themselves?
