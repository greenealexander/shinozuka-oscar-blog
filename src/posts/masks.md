I've always been indifferent to poetry, always dreading assignments in school that involved comprehending them. It's never been a strength of mine to decipher a poem let alone write one, but I had been convinced by a friend of mine to give it a try. I definitely think my writing style I could benefit greatly if I can learn how to think more metaphorically.

My friend suggested that we each write our own poems based on the same theme/idea and see what happens. To say I was nervous is an understatement. I haven’t written anything poetic since my failed attempt at writing a rap song—which needless to say remains unfinished.

However, when she proposed that we write about masks since our prior conversations were already on this theme, I couldn’t help but smile in relief. This is a theme that I’ve thought about a lot, and two of my favorite poems, Genius of the Crowd and Bluebird, both by Charles Bukowski, are linked to this topic. I embedded a few YouTube videos that narrate my favorite poems below in the following section.

## My First Attempts at Poetry 

#### Poem #1

“Stopped at the crosswalk,
I watched the passersby,
Their suits the same color as mine.
Cars inching through this maze,
Destined to repeat in this world and the next,
Covered us in a gray haze.
A continuous drizzle fell from the ashen sky,
Pelting the umbrellas that keep us dry.

Then a car sped by,
Splashing me with water,
Turning my clothes black.
I instantly felt the gaze of those around me.

And like a tooth with a cavity,
I was drilled and injected with grout,
Once again restoring uniformity.”
— Oscar Shinozuka, 2021

#### Poem #2

“Rinse, Repeat, Rinse, Repeat.
Every day I wash more of myself away.
I rinsed my face of its cakey make-up,
But still, it remained.
I removed my shirt, my pants, my underwear, my socks,
But still, it remained.
I stood looking at myself in the mirror,
But only the mask remained.”
— Oscar Shinozuka, 2021

#### Poem #3

“To be in accordance,
With the unspoken laws,
Every day is a performance.

Disregarding their flaws,
And my particularity,
I remain on this stationary stage.

My life: a delicate flame,
With the gentlest breeze,
I am extinguished.
And like a candle,
I am easily replaced.”
— Oscar Shinozuka, 2021

#### Poem #4

“With every passing storm,
However unwilling to conform,
A piece of me washes away.
Tainted by their ideology,
Shrouded in its hypocrisy,
It is me whom I betray.”

## My Thoughts On Writing Poetry (1 Year Later)

In the past year, I have written 40 poems in total, though I never considered writing poetry prior to this. I've always been more interested in writing short stories.However, as someone who has very little writing experience, especially at the time I wrote the poems above, I felt the need to start small. 

It didn't take much time for me to realize that I had many weaknesses. A few being that I struggled with writing effective and profound imagery, metaphors, and similes. These were techniques that all the authors that I admired, such as Stephen King and Edogawa Ranpo, were experts at. These techniques add so much feeling, emotion, and creativity to their works that only add to their brilliantly written plots and characters. To my surprise, despite the fact that I still have much improvement left to be desired, practicing the art of writing poetry has vastly improved my use of those techniques.
