## Overall Review

I’ve been more than happy with my progress through my reading list for 2021. However, I began writing my first mystery story recently, and I found myself struggling more than I thought I would. after reading a couple of non-fiction books on Japan and a handful of fiction written by Japanese authors, I realized that none of them had been mysteries—except for the collection of Edogawa Ranpo short stories. As someone who aspires to write mysteries, I think it goes without saying that I need to read more mysteries, so I decided to make some changes to my reading list by adding a lot of crime fiction.

The first mystery novel I chose to read was Snakeskin Shamisen by Naomi Hirahara. I initially discovered Naomi Hirahara near the beginning of this year when I suddenly received a new follower notification on Twitter. A woman named Naomi Hirahara had suddenly followed me out of nowhere. I was curious to know who this person was and tapped on her profile to realize that she was an Edgar Award-winning author based in Pasadena, California, known for her mysteries and history books on the Japanese American experience. I’m still baffled by how she found my account and what interested her enough to follow me, but I put these thoughts aside and looked her up.

Her website, linked to her Twitter profile, has a complete list of all of the books that she has written and descriptions of their contents. After reading each book's synopsis, I was most interested in Snakeskin Shamisen, the third book of seven in the Mas Arai series, since it had won the Edgar Award—regarded as the most prestigious award in the mystery genre. I also purchased Murder On Bamboo Lane, winner of the T. Jefferson Parker Mystery Award, which I am currently reading.

I fell in love with the protagonist of Snakeskin Shamisen, Mas Arai, a humble gardener and survivor of the Hiroshima bombing, who, despite being 72 years old, has some real konjo, guts. I figured out later that Naomi Hirahara’s father, Isamu, was only miles away from the epicenter of the atomic-bombing in 1945 yet survived. I think that it’s safe to assume that her character Mas Arai may have been inspired by her father, which I found very heartwarming and interesting.

According to Naomi Hirahara’s bio on her website, she “was a reporter and editor of The Rafu Shimpo, America's leading Japanese American newspaper, during the culmination of the redress and reparations movement for Japanese Americans who were forcibly removed from their homes during World War II. During her tenure as editor, the newspaper published a highly-acclaimed inter-ethnic relations series after the L.A. riots.”

Knowing her background helps understand why this book was packed with cultural and historical elements focused mainly on the Japanese American community and other various communities based in California. She does an outstanding job illustrating each community—their thoughts, struggles, history in the United States, culture, and more.

Although the details were very informative, I prefer—am accustomed to—mysteries that involve some trick solved by a brilliant detective with a resolution at the end that, more times than not, blows my mind. I love the chill that runs through my spine, raising goosebumps on my skin as the suspense builds, but I didn’t feel that sensation much when reading Snakeskin Shamisen. Nonetheless, I’ve never read a mystery where the setting played such a major role in the story, making this quite an eye-opener in terms of how to write a mystery.

Honestly, one of the biggest reasons for the average rating I have given this book was because of the high expectations I had going into the book. Despite winning the most prestigious mystery award in America, I thought that it leaned more toward other genres. Like I mentioned above, it was packed with historical and cultural details, which I think took away from the mystery itself. In addition, the clues weren’t subtle enough, basically giving away the mystery, not giving me the opportunity to ponder my own conclusions. And lastly, I found the ending to be very anti-climactic, which again, with my high expectations going in, left me very dissatisfied as a reader. If this were only classified as literary fiction or something along those lines, I would have rated it very highly, but as a mystery, I just couldn’t.

## My Favorite Parts

In this book, Naomi Hirahara had mentioned how innocent Japanese Americans were thrown into internment camps during WWII—some even having to fight for the United States in battle. I really liked the following excerpt because of her use of The Statue of Liberty, playing with what it represents. Despite it being a symbol of freedom, she provides another possibility:

> He felt the worst for the actual eyewitnesses. Mas knew the curse of surviving, of looking normal and unblemished years later but feeling the bomb still burn in his chest had the strangest and most unpredictable times. Now Homeland Security was supposed to protect them all, but Mas knew they were only words. What was home, and what could be secure? Was it only an excuse to push out the poor and unwanted? And what about the statue in New York Harbor, the one that Mas had seen when he had visited his daughter? Wasn’t she holding a torch for newcomers? Or was it now a warning that immigrants should keep their distance?

I always enjoy it when the author includes Japanese culture and seamlessly blends it into the story. Naomi Hirahara did this well many times throughout the book, and the following excerpt is my favorite. If you have any interest in Japanese culture, I think that you’ll really enjoy how Naomi Hirahara mixes them in. Mas is on his way to meet Judge Parker, who, at this point in the book, seemed suspiciously related to the case at hand:

> In Japanese Noh puppet plays, A stage hand called a kurogo runs all the behind-the-scenes activities right on stage. Dressed in all black like a killer ninja, the kurogo moves furniture or changes the actors’ clothing as surreptitiously in unnoticeably as possible. Mas knew that to properly handle Judge and Mrs. Parker, he had to do the same.

## CLARK AND DIVISION

She has a new book being released in August of this year, CLARK AND DIVISION. I’ve included the synopsis of the book below as well as links to her Twitter and her website. If you’re interested, it’s available for pre-order now!

> Twenty-year-old Aki Ito and her parents have just been released from Manzanar, where they have been detained by the US government since the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, together with thousands of other Japanese Americans. The life in California the Itos were forced to leave behind is gone; instead, they are being resettled two thousand miles away in Chicago, where Aki’s older sister, Rose, was sent months earlier and moved to the new Japanese American neighborhood near Clark and Division streets. But on the eve of the Ito family’s reunion, Rose is killed by a subway train.<br><br>
> Aki, who worshipped her sister, is stunned. Officials are ruling Rose’s death a suicide. Aki cannot believe her perfect, polished, and optimistic sister would end her life. Her instinct tells her there is much more to the story, and she knows she is the only person who could ever learn the truth.
