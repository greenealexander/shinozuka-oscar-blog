#### The Long Version

He was born and raised in Newark, Delaware, a quiet and peaceful city on the northeastern coast of the United States. When he was fifteen he moved to Texas, spending the last three years of his adolescent life focusing on soccer—as he had from the age of eight—which led him to get scouted to play for the Lehigh University Men’s Soccer team in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. 

He pursued soccer in hopes of playing as a professional in Japan’s J1 League, but after about 15 years of soccer, at the age of 22, he decided it was clear that one—he wasn’t good enough, and two—he didn’t have the commitment required to reach the professional level, so after his fourth and final season with the Lehigh Mountain Hawks, he felt as if he were back at square one with only one month’s winter vacation and one semester of university left to complete his Asian Studies degree. 

He spent the winter studying abroad in South Korea where he studied the Korean language and Korean History before returning for the spring semester to finish his thesis on karoshi (過労死) and karo-jisatsu (過労自殺)—workplace death and workplace suicide—in Japan during the 90s and early 2000s. 

In search of the next step in his life—with no real direction—he decided to try everything he had wanted to learn when he was younger but didn’t pursue because of soccer. The first of which was dancing. He took a hip hop dance class and immediately fell in love with it, but didn’t see it as a career, so he moved on to the next thing on the list—drawing. 

After graduating from Lehigh University in 2019, he moved to Japan, a dream of his since he was a little boy, and lived in a share house located in Saitama Prefecture. His first year in Japan was spent learning how to draw. At first, he would draw in the evenings after working at the sheet metal factory, but after a month of trying to both work and focus on learning how to draw, he decided that it would be more worth his time to put all his time into drawing. He quit his job after just a month and lived on the money he saved up during his university days. However, as a year and a half passed, which included a move to Kobe, Japan in Hyogo Prefecture, he realized that being an artist was not as fulfilling as he had hoped, and even more importantly, he had run out of money. 

Putting being an artist to the side, he buckled down and did whatever jobs he could find. Because his Japanese was just barely conversational level, he didn't have much to choose from. However, after several months of hopping from one part-time job to the next ranging from vegetable packing, construction, and working as a mover to working as a graphic designer in a nice but small air-conditioned office, he landed a job at an eel restaurant as a waiter/cook which would turn out to be a match made in heaven.

Though he had finally solved his financial problems, he still had some thinking to do about his future. During this time, he noticed that he preferred creating the backstories of characters to actually drawing them. Again he was back at square one, and this time, it was in a field that was his worst subject in school—writing.

He searched online to find out what advice was available to those who wanted to become better writers. Many successful writers stressed the need to write as often as possible, since writing, like any skill, is something that requires practice. Then his heart sank as he noticed that these writers also emphasized the need to read a lot. He hated writing, but he hated reading even more. Back in school, English classes were mandatory and always forced him to read from a handpicked list of books, though most of his reading actually consisted of SparkNotes. The books on the school’s required reading list were always uninspiring and dry, so he never understood why those books were selected. He had translated this animosity for books read in school to all books in general and refused to read at all, always preferring to watch the movie version of titles scoffing at those who would recommend books. Luckily, that slowly began to change.

Now that he had committed to being a writer, he realized he didn’t know where to start. What would he write about? The question left him overwhelmed, so logically—or perhaps taking the easy way out—he began with reading. Knowing that he loved crime mystery movies and television shows, he chose probably the most famous and most highly referenced mystery series—the Sherlock Holmes series by Conan Doyle. 

To make a long story short, he loved it and made light work of the entire series and quickly looked for more like it. He read the most famous works by Agatha Christie before moving on to reading books by Keigo Higashino (東野 圭吾), Edogawa Ranpo (江戸川 乱歩), Stephen King, Stieg Larsson, and many other authors. After a year of consistent reading, he had fallen in love with it. During this time, he also started writing poetry. His first attempts at writing short stories were bland, lacking the imagery and creative metaphors that he enjoyed in the books he read. In addition, since poetry is a short form of writing, it allowed him to start and finish his work much faster—sometimes only requiring thirty minutes to complete—which enabled him to play with specific ideas quickly and move on to the next. 

He then started a book review blog, one that you’re probably familiar with if you’re here, to practice laying out and organizing his thoughts. It was also a way to express his pent-up feelings about the books he read since he had no friends that were interested in reading and thus no one to discuss the books with.
