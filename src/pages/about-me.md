## Why Did I Start This Blog?

Hello and welcome to my crime fiction book review blog! My name is Oscar Shinozuka and I've been an avid reader of crime fiction for as long as I can remember. I started this blog as a way to share my love for the genre with others who are just as passionate about it as I am.

I believe that crime fiction offers readers a unique opportunity to explore the darker side of human nature, from greed and jealousy to violence and revenge. By reading crime fiction, we can not only be entertained but also gain a deeper understanding of the human psyche. Through this blog, I hope to introduce readers to some of the best crime fiction books out there and provide them with honest and insightful reviews.

Also, it has been a dream of mine to one day write a crime fiction novel. I figured that for starters, as someone who has been called a below average writer by my writing teachers throughout my school years - and rightfully so, I should read as much crime fiction I can get my hands on. This blog is me documenting my progression as I attempt to write my own novel.

## Japan Noir

Japan has a rich history of crime fiction, with many writers exploring themes such as honor, loyalty, and betrayal. One of the most famous Japanese crime fiction authors is Natsuo Kirino, whose novel Out won the Edgar Award for Best Novel in 2004. Other notable Japanese crime fiction writers include Higashino Keigo, Fuminori Nakamura, and Miyuki Miyabe.

Through their works, these authors offer readers a glimpse into Japan's unique culture and society, while also delivering gripping and suspenseful stories. If you're a fan of crime fiction and looking to explore new authors and settings, I highly recommend checking out some of Japan's noir offerings.

## Living In Japan

As someone who has lived in Japan for several years, I can attest to the country's unique culture and way of life. From the bustling city streets of Tokyo to the peaceful countryside of Hokkaido, Japan offers a diverse range of experiences for both locals and foreigners alike.

For crime fiction fans, living in Japan can be particularly interesting, as many novels are set in real-life locations around the country. Whether you're exploring the neon-lit alleys of Kabukicho or the serene temples of Kyoto, there's always something new and exciting to discover in Japan.
