### About Me!

Continuing with my exploration of Japanese authors, I read <i>A Man</i> by Keiichiro Hirano, winner of Japan’s prestigious Yomiuri Prize for Literature. This book was his first book to be translated into English, and I was super excited to read this book after reading its synopsis on Goodreads (which I've included below), but I felt that it didn't live up to its potential.

> Akira Kido is a divorce attorney whose own marriage is in danger of being destroyed by emotional disconnect. With a midlife crisis looming, Kido’s life is upended by the reemergence of a former client, Rié Takemoto. She wants Kido to investigate a dead man—her recently deceased husband, Daisuké. Upon his death she discovered that he’d been living a lie. His name, his past, his entire identity belonged to someone else, a total stranger. The investigation draws Kido into two intriguing mysteries: finding out who Rié’s husband really was and discovering more about the man he pretended to be. Soon, with each new revelation, Kido will come to share the obsession with—and the lure of—erasing one life to create a new one.

The beginning of Kido's investigation was dull and dreary. He had questioned several people related to the man who's identity was stolen by Rie's husband—his brother, an ex-girlfriend, and a few others—but had little luck finding any real hints to "X's" true identity. Until Kido started to make progress in his investigation, most of the first half of the book focused more on Kido's background as a third-genertation Zainichi born and raised in Kanazawa, Japan and his failing marriage.
