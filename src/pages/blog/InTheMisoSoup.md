## Overall Review

I first heard about Ryu Murakami while I was researching about Haruki Murakami's life and work. As I was reading an article about him, I learned that one of his favorite authors is Ryu Murakami. It’s funny—just weeks earlier, I had never known any authors by the name Murakami, and now, I know of two by that name—both of which I have come to admire. After learning about Ryu Murakami, I did some quick research into his work and realized that I had actually read one of Ryu Murakami’s works during my University days titled Audition. Unfortunately, due to my lousy study habits and disinterest in books at the time, I don’t remember the details of it that much.

There are other books I could have chosen by Ryu Murakami, but as I searched on Goodreads for one of his books, In The Miso Soup was the first to pop up, and shortly after I read the brief synopsis supplied on the app, I was instantly hooked: 

>It is just before New Year’s. Frank, an overweight American tourist, has hired Kenji to take him on a guided tour of Tokyo’s sleazy nightlife on three successive evenings. But Frank’s behavior is so strange that Kenji begins to entertain a horrible suspicion: that his new client is in fact the serial killer currently terrorizing the city. It isn’t until later, however, that Kenji learns exactly how much he has to fear and how irrevocably his encounter with this great white whale of an American will change his life.

As the synopsis's final sentence suggests, this psychological thriller also possesses a philosophical aspect that questions Japanese society’s morality while making some light comparisons with American culture and mainly criticizing Japan—and I love it for that. For most of my life, I had put Japan up on a pedestal with the impression that Japan was flawless, and it wasn’t until I moved to Japan in late 2019 that I slowly became aware that everything I thought to be true about Japan was nothing but inaccurate stereotypes, fracturing my ideal image of Japan. To be clear, I’m not saying that I like to hear criticisms of Japan or that I’m going to move somewhere else because I really love it here; it’s just that I’ve heard so much praise and admiration that it’s nice to hear the other side so that I can understand Japan’s imperfections.   

Also, this book is set in Kabuki-Cho, the red-light district of downtown Tokyo. I feel that having the knowledge from reading Tokyo Vice by Jake Adelstein earlier this year enhanced the level of enjoyment I had when reading In The Miso Soup. There is a chapter in Tokyo Vice that specifically tackles Kabuki-Cho and the notoriously dark and disturbing activities that take place there. The topics include the Prostitution Prevention Law, human trafficking, host and hostess popularity, yakuza involvement, and more. Reading Tokyo Vice is not necessary to appreciate In The Miso Soup.

I want to add this one bit where Adelstein makes some closing remarks about host and hostess popularity in Japan. Hosts and hostesses are men and women who get paid by people to be companions for a few hours (not sex) to listen to their problems like a friend would. In this excerpt below, Adelstein highlights the loneliness that Japanese people are experiencing in modern-day Japan, which is a recurring theme throughout In The Miso Soup as well:

>There is, admittedly, the underlying game that’s the lure (but where is it not?): is this evening of sympathy and champagne going to lead to sexual intercourse? Be that as it may, what the clubs are really fuelled by is alienation, boredom, and loneliness. The rates are not unreasonable, but the costs in human terms are incredibly high.

Overall, I really loved this suspenseful and philosophical short novel (180 pages)! It’s one of my favorite books I’ve ever read!

## Japanese Loneliness

In all of the four books I’ve read this year—Tokyo Vice, Tales of Japanese Mystery and Imagination, Men Without Women, and finally In The Miso Soup, loneliness has been a major theme, which clearly isn’t a coincidence. I knew that at least when compared to Americans, Japanese people are usually not as socially extroverted, but I never would have guessed how much loneliness exists in modern-day Japan including Tokyo, the densest city in the world with a population of over 38,000,000. With that many people in one city, it’s hard to imagine people being lonely. Through Kenji, Ryu Murakami elegantly illustrates the narrow-minded attitude of Japanese people:

>...this pub was like a symbol of Japan, self-contained, unwilling to interact with the world outside, just communicating with itself in every breath—mmm, ahhh. People who’ve spent their lives living in that kind of bubble tend to panic in emergencies, to lose the ability to communicate, and to end up getting killed.
> <cite> — In The Miso Soup, 119 </cite>

Needless to say, not everyone is as narrow-minded as described above, and I think that it is fair to assume that Ryu Murakami knows this as well. That being said, I’ve met a lot of people that fit this description. I’ve met people who have never gone abroad—a small minority never even venturing out of their own hometown/city, people with no hobbies or interests outside of their work, and people who can’t hold a conversation for very long—let alone maintain eye contact. 

I also lived in a share house located in Saitama for eight months where my housemates would walk past each other in the hallways without batting an eye, and when greeted with a “hello” or “good morning,” would refuse to acknowledge it. This was obviously a shock to me, considering Japanese people are known for their politeness—and it was my first time living with Japanese people other than my relatives. Since then, I have lived with other Japanese people and had a much more pleasant experience, so I think I was just a bit unfortunate.

I don’t have any real thoughts to share at this time on the following excerpt below, but I wanted to include it here because it caught my eye:

>Jun’s goal is to avoid extremes like that and be as normal as possible. It’s not easy to live a normal life, though. Parents, teachers, government—they all teach you how to live the dreary, deadening life of a slave, but nobody teaches you how to live normally.”

## American Loneliness: “Accept It”

Inevitably, while showing a drunk American tourist around Tokyo’s red-light district for a couple of nights, there would be a moment where Kenji would have to listen to his client open up about his childhood—which usually consisted of some “complicated family situation,” ending with a “confession” of their loneliness. After serving nearly 200 Americans during his time as an unlicensed tour guide, Kenji gives an example of a typical story that he’d hear from a client and then makes some comments on American loneliness:

>Pop stopped coming home, and then the next year at Christmas there was a man I didn’t know, and my mother said from now on this is your father. I was only six so I didn’t have much choice in the matter, but it took me a long time to accept it, two or three years about, and then at some point the man started hitting me. This was back in North Carolina, and we had a custom where we didn’t mow or walk on the grass until May, to let it grow, and the man was a salesman from the West Coast and didn’t know about that, so he used to walk all over the lawn in front of the house in early spring, and Pop had planted that lawn, so it really upset me, and I warned the man, I told him again and again, but he kept walking on the grass, and finally I called him this really bad name, which I must have just learned because I didn’t even know what it meant. That was the first time he hit me, and then I had to start all over again, trying to get to a point where I could, you know …accept it.
><br>I remember the American making this particular confession, and the way his voice caught when he said “accept it.” Americans don’t talk about just grinning and bearing it, which is the Japanese approach to so many things. After listening to a lot of these stories, I began to think that American loneliness where you need to keep struggling to accept a situation is fundamentally different from the sort you know you’ll get through if you just hang in there. I don’t think I could stand the sort of loneliness Americans feel.
> <cite> — In The Miso Soup, 38-39 </cite>

As an American (born and raised), I had a hard time understanding what Ryu Murakami meant by American loneliness. I believe that acceptance occurs when the circumstances are such that the individual cannot change the situation to make it better, so the only sensible thing to do would be to acknowledge his/her own helplessness, which can cause them to feel the loneliness Kenji refers to. However, the idea of accepting a situation for what it is doesn’t always instill loneliness. Instead, I feel that it can empower an individual to overcome any situation, no matter how dire the straits are. 

By accepting their reality head-on, they can focus on the things they have the power to affect and change, thus moving in a positive direction rather than staying stationary in never-ending misery and loneliness. This, however simple it may sound, is not an easy task as humans have a proclivity toward negative emotion. 

In the aforementioned scenario, the young boy would indeed be lonely after losing his birth father, who an abusive step-father replaced. Powerless, the little boy will undoubtedly struggle with acceptance, and even if he were capable of acceptance, he would most likely tilt more toward playing the role of victim rather than of survivor. So I cannot say that acceptance doesn’t lead to loneliness, but it is certainly not the only place it can lead to.

Ultimately, I think that the Japanese way of “grinning and bearing” and the American way of acceptance are more similar than different, despite being worded differently. Don’t you?

## My Favorite Part of the Book

At the climax of the book, Frank slaughters everyone in one of the pubs sparing only Kenji, who he considers a friend—perhaps his only one. After leaving the scene of the massacre and heading out to the street, Frank tells Kenji that he is going to chat up one of the women standing outside and that Kenji was free to go anywhere he pleased. Frank even permitted him to go to the police station, which was just down the street and in view from where they were standing. Now alone, Kenji was faced with a decision—to report the murders to the police or walk away and go home:

>Explaining the situation to the cops would have been a pain in the ass of epic proportions. A pain in the ass, I muttered to myself, and heard myself chuckle. How many hours—no, days—would the police grill me? It wouldn’t escape their notice that I was a tourist guide without a license. That would probably spell trouble for Yokoyama-san, too. And when the whole story came out it would destroy my mother. Not only would the police forbid me to work, they’d now be keeping an eye on me. I know how they operate. I’d be treated from the start as a probable accomplice. It would destroy my Mom, I thought again… and then I thought of Lady #3. Naturally she and Mr. Children and the others had families too. I remembered their corpses, and the actual killings. These images flickered through my mind like drug flashbacks, but unaccompanied by any real sense of revulsion or outrage. I remembered the sound of the guy’s neck bones cracking, but all I could think was: So that’s what it’s like when you break somebody into two. Maybe my nerves still hadn’t thawed out. I tried to feel sorry for the people who’d been killed but found, to my horror, that I couldn’t feel any sympathy for them at all.
><br>I’d spent two evenings with Frank but I had just met the people who died in the pub. I wonder if the reason I couldn’t sympathize with the victims was that I’d come to empathize with Frank, but that didn’t seem true. I had no affection for Frank. I don’t think it would have bothered me if he were arrested, or even killed. But those people in the omiai pub had been like androids or something. Lady #2, Yuko, had said she was there because she felt “kinda lonely.” She would actually have preferred to be doing something else but had no idea what that might be so decided to check out a matchmaking pub and at least talk to somebody. Lady #3 was the same. She didn’t know what she wanted to do, so she ended up singing an Amuro song all by herself in that lonely place. Mr. Children was intent only on hooking up with Lady #5, whose only reaction to insults like “I can tell you you are the type of broad who works it was telephone clubs” was a simpering grin. […] They were like automatons programmed to portray certain stereotypes, those people. The truth is it had bugged the hell out of me just to be around them, and I began to wonder if they weren’t all filled with sawdust and scraps of vinyl, like stuffed animals, rather than flesh and blood. Even when I saw their throats slit and the gore oozing out, it hadn’t seemed real to me. I remembered thinking, as I watched the blood drip down from Lady #5’s throat, it looked like soy sauce. Imitation human beings, that’s what they were.
><br>[…] What did I have in common with the victims? Just that we were all human trash. I couldn’t kid myself—I wasn’t so different from them. That’s why I understood them, and that’s why they bugged me so much.
> <cite>— In The Miso Soup, 132-133 </cite>

In Kenji’s inner dialogue, he primarily criticizes the people that were murdered and eventually himself, saying very little about Frank, the man who just slaughtered several people for no apparent reason. He even goes as far as calling himself and his fellow countrymen and women “human trash.” In the end, Kenji also doesn’t report Frank to the police, though if he had, he would have failed Frank’s test—after Frank had left Kenji alone, he stayed close, observing if Kenji, his “friend,” would go to the cops or not—and probably would have had his throat slit like the others. 

Also, I love this scene because of the unique use of nicknames—Lady #2, Lady #3, Lady #5, and Mr. Children. Ryu Murakami, in this case, instead of using nicknames to show the closeness of friends, the nicknames indicate the distance between Kenji and the strangers. On top of that, these labels further demonstrate Kenji’s “imitation human” impression along with the descriptions of sawdust filled stuffed animals and soy sauce substituting blood.

Very early on in this book, Ryu Murakami brings up karoshi and the tanshin-funin system issues that continue to plague modern-day Japan:

>If I can’t answer these questions, it’s not because I’m particularly stupid. Nobody writes about these things in the newspaper or weeklies, or talks about them on TV. No one teaches us why karoshi has to exist in this country, or the tanshin-fun system that the rest of the world seems to think is so perverse.
> <cite> — In The Miso Soup, 43 </cite>

He states that these issues are not written about or talked about on TV, which makes me feel like this book was his way of writing about his thoughts on the state of Japan in hopes of starting a conversation about Japan’s loneliness problem that continues to steadily spread through Japan today.
