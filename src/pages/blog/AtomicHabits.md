At the beginning of this year, I had made the decision to allow myself to have more fun. Not that I don’t like to read books and write, but I want to have a social life to go along with it, and I have some other hobbies that I wanted to dedicate some time to as well. 

In order to achieve this balance, I thought it would be wise to make a schedule for myself starting with waking up earlier, at 5 am, and organizing my entire day until I go to bed. At first, this seemed like a great idea, but it turned into a nightmare. For some reason that I couldn’t understand, I was unable to get myself to do the tasks that I had planned. I was left in a state of disappointment that continued for weeks as I tried to force myself to follow my program. Long story short, I learned that I didn’t know how to make an effective schedule and that I had a lot of bad habits that prevented me from making progress. This is when I decided that I needed to become more educated on habits. I wanted to understand how to create and implement good habits while eliminating bad ones. I had already heard of James Clear’s book Atomic Habits when I’d gone through some Youtube rabbit holes and decided to give it a read. I mean what did I have to lose?

## Overall Review

The book started off with a brief introduction of the author—-who he is, why he chose to write the book, what makes him an expert, etc. As I read of Mr. Clear’s story, I immediately gained a massive amount of respect for him and his experiences. I wanted to mention this part of the book because I found it incredibly important in actually absorbing the information. I mean, I knew nothing about this guy or his qualifications that made him a so-called expert in habits. 

He explained how he dreamed of being a professional baseball player, but on the last day of his sophomore year of high school his face was smashed in by a baseball bat. After being released from a medically induced coma he was gradually able to regain his sense of smell, though his eyes would bulge out of his skull when he blew his nose, and in a year of hell dealing with seizures and vision problems, he was also able to regain his motor skills. Making a full recovery was one thing, but getting back to playing baseball was another. He went from being a starter on the varsity team to being sent down to play with the junior varsity team. In the following years, he started practicing good habits after getting into Denison University, where he played baseball. 6 years after his accident, he was:

>selected as the top male athlete at Denison University and named to the ESPN Academic All-American Team—an honor given to just thirty-three players across the country. By the time I graduated, I was listed in the school record books in eight different categories. That same year, I was awarded the university’s highest academic honor, the President’s Medal.

Although he points out that he never played professionally, he believes that he fulfilled the potential that he had and he believes that the ideas and concepts in the book could help others fulfill their potential as well. 

Reading about his struggles and what he had to overcome in order to achieve what he went on to achieve was inspiring and earned a rapport with me immediately. I too had dreams of playing professionally, though I played soccer instead of baseball, and his story resonated with me big time. This isn’t some guy talking about habits, he lived it, and did it successfully with the results to back it up. I instantly felt my focus increase and reading the book became even easier.

>The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get a 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero.

>You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than your current results.

>In the words of three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of itself.” The same is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.

>As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”

>It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues. It can be difficult to go to bed early if you watch television in your bedroom each night. It can be hard to study in the living room without getting distracted if that’s where you always play video games. But when you step outside your normal environment, you leave your behavioral biases behind. You aren’t battling old environmental cues, which allows new habits to form without interruption. 
><cite> - James Clear, pg. 88 </cite>


>When you can’t manage to get an entirely new environment, redefine or rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for work, study, exercise, entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find useful is, “One space, one use."
><cite> - James Clear, pg. 89 </cite>

>This finding contradicted the prevailing view at the time, which considered heroin addiction to be a permanent and irreversible condition. Instead, Robins revealed that addictions continuously dissolve if there was a radical change in the environment. In Vietnam, soldiers spent all day surrounded by cues triggering heroine use: it was easy to access, you are engulfed by the constant stress of war, built friendships with fellow soldiers who were also a heroin users, and they were thousands of miles from home. Once a soldier returned to the United States, though, he found himself in an environment devoid of those triggers. When the context changed, so did the habit.

>The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve this quality is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. ><cite> - James Clear, pg. 93 </cite>


>Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control. Make the keys of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.

>At the end of the term, he was surprised to find it all the best photos are produced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students were busy taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile the quality group sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had little to show for their efforts other than unverified theories and one mediocre photo.

>You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33% loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “the first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.”
