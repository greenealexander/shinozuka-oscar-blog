Despite a slow start to this year’s reading list—this being just the second book that I’ve finished this year—I am making smooth and steady progress, and at the same time, starting to enjoy the books I’ve selected. However, some of the books that I had started earlier this year proved to be hard to read to completion. I’m currently in the middle of reading around ten books, which is as absurd and silly as it sounds. I would start a book and lose interest immediately or gradually, but I never made it halfway through any of them. 

Initially, I sought books written by authors I hadn’t read before in hopes of experiencing a more diverse set of writing styles. I also had a desire to engage with genres that I don’t typically read in an attempt to broaden my horizons (since I mainly stick to mysteries and crime fiction), but clearly, it just wasn’t clicking for me. Although I still intend to power through and finish most of these books that I have started, I decided to do the only thing that I thought would get me back on track for the year—pick up books written by the authors I know and love. Looking at my new bookshelf ( I used to just pile books under my bed since I had nowhere else to store them in my old apartment), books instantly stood out to me, the first being Keigo Higashino’s The Name of the Game is Kidnapping, the second I’m sure you can guess. It’s hard to go wrong with Stephen King, as I’m sure many would agree. 

## Overall Review

I find Stephen King’s approach to crime fiction interesting because his stories don’t focus on a trick or a complicated phenomenon like many other mysteries that I adore. Instead, he focuses on the characters and how they think and interact to make an epic novel. What’s astounding is that this series has so many characters. He can make each of them shine, no matter if they’re the protagonist or a janitor who makes a few appearances. 

Finders Keepers is the second book of an award-winning trilogy.

I was engrossed from beginning to end

I highly regret not taking notes and marking the book as I read. I didn’t have any intentions of writing a review when I started, but after reading it, I was overcome with an urge to share my thoughts on the book, and so here we are.
