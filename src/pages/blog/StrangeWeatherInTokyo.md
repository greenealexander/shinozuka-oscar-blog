## Overall Review

I wanted to continue expanding my awareness of Japanese authors, especially more recent authors. I didn’t have any expectations going into this book since it was my first time reading a book by Kawakami. 

Unfortunately, I wasn’t a big fan of the book. It was boring, plain and simple. It was the first book in a while that I haven’t marked up with post-its. It was also the first book where I fell asleep in public while reading. I usually read while I’m on the train or at the beach or at the AEON Mall to make sure that I keep my focus. For some reason, I find myself in a more focused state, though after reading Atomic Habits, I have a good idea of why this happens. I live in a one-room apartment, so my subconscious mind probably starts going into sleep mode as soon as I enter my room since that’s where I sleep every day without fail. This is the main reason why I started reading out in public in the first place. Constantly switching locations to make sure that there is no subconscious cue that would cause me to fall asleep. 

Despite my effort though, I fell asleep on numerous occasions. I just didn’t find the book captivating at all nor did I connect with the characters. The dialogue was too simple which only made it more boring. I’m just glad it was a short book, so I can move on to the next one.
