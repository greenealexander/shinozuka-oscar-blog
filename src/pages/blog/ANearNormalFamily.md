## Overall Review

This was the first book that I read after about a decade without reading a single book. This book just happened to be suggested by Amazon—how they knew I would be interested in this book is beyond me, and the author was a mystery to me as well, but I am so grateful to have found this book. 

A Nearly Normal Family is a very unique mystery novel told in a three-part structure—each part told from the perspective of each character of a family of three after the daughter becomes a murder suspect. Told through an unfiltered lens, the family dynamics exhibited in this story are very relatable to any parent or teenager and question the role of “love.” What is the glue that holds families together? The author, M. T. Edvardsson, gives an alternative answer to that question—lies. 

This is one of my favorite books of all time and is the only book I’ve read three times in quick succession. Although I really enjoyed the audiobook version (read by Richard Armitage, George Maguire, and Emily Watson), I do sometimes regret not reading. Had I read the book, I could have marked it up and and taken notes in order to provide a detailed break down here. However, the audiobook was so good that I have chosen to forgiven myself, and I would highly recommend that you look into the audio version as well.
