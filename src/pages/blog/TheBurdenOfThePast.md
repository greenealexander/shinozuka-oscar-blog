## Overall Review

I don’t remember what sparked my interest in South Korea, but for some reason, I became interested enough to study abroad there during the Winter of my last year of University (2018-2019). While I was there, I took a class on Korean history where I learned about Japan’s colonization of Korea and the United States’ role in Korea's split into North and South but learned little about more recent issues involving relations with Japan. It was also during my time in South Korea that a fellow foreign exchange student told me about some Japanese cars being brutally vandalized near the campus we were staying in, which further piqued my curiosity. 

More recently, I stumbled upon a book by Korean-American author Min Jin Lee called Pachinko, a historical novel set between 1910 and 1989 following a Korean family who eventually immigrates to Japan. Obviously, it’s unnecessary to know the history involving Japan and Korea to enjoy the book, but I thought it would make the experience more enjoyable to have that knowledge. It would also help me when I inevitably write a book review on the novel :)

This book, The Burden of the Past: Problems of Historical Perception in Japan-Korea Relations by Kan Kimura, contains case studies on two issues concerning Korea-Japan relations: the textbook issue and the comfort women issue. He emphasizes “the significance of developments in the 1980s and 1990s in fixing the historical perception dispute in its current form,” looking at empirical data to explain why the history textbooks and the comfort women attracted attention as issues almost forty years after the end of World War II and the liberation of the Korean peninsula from colonial rule. “Why did the gap between Japanese and South Korean perceptions of history that had previously remained latent suddenly become politicized during this period?”

I never understood why the dispute about the comfort women issue had become such a big deal, especially because I was somewhat aware of the fact that there was an agreement between Japan and South Korea (Claims Settlement Agreement) which I thought should have put the issue to bed, but clearly, that hasn’t been the case. 

Kan Kimura does an excellent job outlining the political and economic landscapes of both Japan and South Korea after WWII up to the present, which was extremely helpful in grasping a full understanding of how and why things unfolded the way they did, demonstrating how the timing of significant political and economic events—the May 18th coup d'etat in 1980 (South Korea), democratization, growing nationalism, various statements made by Japanese government officials, generation shifts (prewar to postwar), and globalization—lead to the souring of relations.

I thought this book would be too heavy for me since I don’t think of myself as a history buff. I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to read the whole thing through, but surprisingly, I found this book to be an outstanding book that answered the questions above and beyond my expectations. In the following section, I will go further and include quotes on topics that I personally found the most interesting. Obviously, there is too much information to sufficiently go over everything, so I’d highly recommend this book to those interested in an unbiased analysis of Japan and South Korea's perception dispute.

## How Does A Dispute Develop?

I thought that it would be beneficial for a lot of people to understand, “What preconditions must pertain for an event to develop into a dispute?” I found this explanation to be very useful in understanding the disputes between Japan and South Korea—and disputes in general—so I have included it below:

>What preconditions must pertain for an event to develop into a dispute? There are at least three. First, there must be multiple actors who attach meaning to an event. In other words, no matter how much potential significance an event might have, if its existence and significance are not “discovered” by multiple actors, it might as well have never existed.
><br>Second, those actors must have different perceptions of the same event. Even if multiple actors find meaning in an event, to the extent that they share the same perception in relation to it—for example, which country should have possession of a certain island or how a certain historical event should be interpreted—there again will be no conflict.
><br>Third, the multiple actors must recognize the existence of sufficient benefit to stir them into action. If, for example, multiple actors attach meaning to an event, even if that meaning is different for each actor, the actors must attach a sufficient level of importance to the meanings they have ascribed before they will take action. What is important here is that, given two actors attaching different value to the same event, when one actor launches action based on that value, a clash with the other becomes inevitable. Obviously, that clash will damage the existing relationship between the two actors and the initial actor will lose some benefit previously garnered from the relationship. Consequently, for an actor to initiate action, they must have prior expectation of reaping benefit sufficient to outweigh the possible demerits of that action.

## The Comfort Women Issue

Before reading this book, I thought that the dispute was mainly about the South Korean government seeking legal compensation from Japan due to some kind of involvement in forcing Korean women to work as sex workers. As terrible as it is, I was under the assumption that Japan had already paid compensation decades ago when the Claims Settlement Agreement was signed, so I had some confusion as to why this dispute was still ongoing. What I learned was that it wasn’t the South Korean government that was pressing for compensation, but the various South Korean civil rights groups:

>Clearly, the Claims Settlement Agreement presents substantial hurdles to the South Korean government in seeking legal compensation from Japan, which is why successive administrations have in fact tried to avoid the issue. The Chongdaehyop and other South Korean civil rights groups, however, have continued to press strongly for compensation from the Japanese government since 1992, and their position has always received a high level of support in South Korea. Postdemocratization, it has been difficult for the government to directly oppose these groups because of the strong public criticism it would face.
> <cite> — Kan Kimura, pg. 127 </cite>

Regardless of how substantial the hurdle is after Asahi Shimbun released a story on military involvement in 1992 just before Miyazawa Kiichi, Japan’s Priminster, was set to visit South Korea—even though they had no evidence—the Japanese government was forced to look into the issue. At the time, the Japanese government thought it was only a matter of time before evidence proving their involvement was discovered, so the decision to make a preemptive apology seemed like the logical thing to do.

Interestingly enough, after the investigation was concluded, no evidence was found that could hold the Japanese government legally responsible for the comfort women in South Korea:

>Of course, many documents were found indicating Japanese government involvement in the comfort women issue. The explanation given by Chief Cabinet Secretary Kato—what we have called here the second Kato Statement—on July 6, 1992, was that a series of investigations had discovered 127 documents—seventy at the Defense Agency; fifty-two at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; four at the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare; and one at the Ministry of Education—revealing that the Japanese government had been involved in the establishment of comfort stations, the creation of recruiting regulations, comfort station management and surveillance, maintenance of hygiene in comfort stations and among comfort women, and the issuing of identification papers and other documents to comfort station personnel.
><br>However, none of these documents directly indicated that the Japanese government had any legal responsibility in relation to the comfort women. Under prewar Japanese law, the existence of sex workers per see was lawful, and the fact that the Japanese government and military had some degree of involvement with these workers did not necessarily mean that it had directly engaged in unlawful acts. Above all, the documents that both governments and the public had most wanted and expected to be discovered—namely evidence that the Japanese government had been directly involved in illegal acts in the process of recruiting the comfort women—did not emerge.
> <cite> — Kan Kimura, pg. 128-129 </cite>

Given that documentation wasn’t enough to hold the Japanese government responsible, the conversation changed to focus on whether coercion was used to recruit comfort women. Although nothing emerged that could hold them responsible, the Japanese government was at an impasse. They had already released a statement apologizing for the hardships they caused the comfort women in South Korea, but now, they were “bound by its own prior words and actions.”

Unfortunately for both governments, despite the South Korean government announcing that it didn’t intend to seek compensation on March 13, 1993, the Chongdaehyop, South Korea’s most influential comfort women advocacy group, voiced their opposition to the decision calling it “inadequate.” And shortly after the announcement in May of 1993, Japan experienced a political shift that ceased diplomatic operations. 

Later, after getting permission from the Chongdaehyop, the Japanese government sent an investigation team to South Korea to explore the subject of coercion which was followed by a statement by Chief Cabinet Secretary Kono announcing the results of their findings (the statement is only the first paragraph): 

>The recruitment of the comfort women was conducted mainly by private recruiters who acted in response to the request of the military. The government study has revealed that in many cases they were recruited against their own will, through coaxing, coercion, etc., and that, at times, administrative/military personnel directly took part in the recruitment.
><br>It should be noted that while the two Kato Statements focused primarily on the recruiting of comfort women from the Korean peninsula, the Kono statement covered comfort women in general, including those from other regions. It had already become clear from materials that the Imperial Japanese Army had coercively recruited comfort women from the Chinese mainland and parts of Southeast Asia. To that extent, the Kono Statement’s observation that “at times, administrative/military personnel directly too part I the recruitment” (emphasis inserted by the author) was certainly not a mistake. In other words, the statement skillfully manages to admit that the recruiting of comfort women was in fact coercive by adding the results of investigations in South Korea to the already verified cases in China and Southeast Asia.
><br>[...] What is sometimes misunderstood is that the statement is not a concrete admission of direct and organized conscription of comfort women by the Japanese government, much less a declaration that all comfort women were coercively recruited.
><br>[...] In any case, in the context of the times, the Kono Statement was the product of political compromise between the Japanese and South Korean governments, which meant that both governments had to bear responsibility for it. However, the Miyazawa cabinet was dissolved before it could meet its obligations, and eventually the Kono Statement would end up being abandoned even by the South Korean government.

There is obviously a lot more covered in the book, but I’ve already included more than I probably should have, so I’ll stop here :)

## The Textbook Issue

For those who are as clueless as I was about this issue, I’ve included an excerpt that spells out why this issue is critical in understanding the souring of relations between Japan and South Korea. Obviously, since this issue is focused on Japanese history textbooks, historical perception will certainly be discussed; however, the textbook issue has less to do with the content inside Japanese textbooks as one might think:

>There are solid grounds for looking at the history textbook issue. For a start, government involvement in the process of textbook creation in both countries (albeit in different forms) means that revision of history textbooks can to some extent be regarded as mirroring changes in the historical perceptions of the respective governments and societies. Thus we can trace historical perceptions in both countries through changes in history textbooks and their references—which is my primary reason for electing to examine them.
><br>[…] As I explained from the data in table 1.2, the textbook issue came to the forefront from the 1980s to around 2005, a period marked by a sharp rise in the number of textbook references to the era of Japan’s colonial rule in the Korean peninsula and the years before and after. In other words, Japanese history textbooks during that period changed in a way that brought them more in line with South Korean demands—yet these same textbooks were lambasted by the South Koreans. By analyzing this apparent contradiction, we may gain a more concrete understanding of how the history textbook dispute developed and what factors shaped its course.
> <cite> — Kan Kimura, pg. 49-50 </cite>

I was taken aback when I learned that Japanese history textbooks were “more in line with South Korean demands.” Apparently, what started the dispute was a reporting mistake, which didn’t go unnoticed by their close neighbors South Korea:

>In Japan, when the content of new textbooks has been finalized, all the new textbooks for each subject in each grade are released simultaneously. At the time, it was standard practice in the Japanese media for this mountain of new textbooks to be divided up and assigned to press club journalists, who would individually provide a summary of the results of their analysis. Along the way, the journalist who had been assigned the Jikkyo Shuppan history textbook heard that during the screening process, the publisher had been pressured by the Ministry of Education to change “invasion” to “advance.” Although this had actually occurred a the previous year, the journalist mistakenly assumed the publishing company had been required to make the above change during the 1982 screening process, which was what he reported to his fellow journalists. What emerged as a result was a statement that publishing companies had been forced to change “invasion” to “advance” in the 1982 screening process. Further, the Japanese media, including the reporter’s own newspaper, somehow failed to check the actual text of the textbook before and after the screening.
><br>[...] The Japanese media of course subsequently admitted their mistake and issued retractions. However, these retractions reached a few ears, particularly in South Korea, and the idea that the 1982 screening forced publishers to change the term “invasion” to “advance” began to evince a life of its own.
> <cite> — Kimura, pg. 12-13 </cite>

Kan Kimura continues, taking a deeper look into why people in both countries believed this mistake to be true even after retractions were made. I’m not going to go into this topic any further here. If you made it this far, thank you so much, and I hope I was able to pique your interest in this topic by giving you an idea of what the book is like!
