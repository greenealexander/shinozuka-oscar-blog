## Masks: An Attempt At Poetry

I've been convinced by Mitsuru (@AkaiGeisha on Twitter) to try writing some poetry. I've always been indifferent to poetry. I’ve never been a huge reader of poetry because I found poems hard to comprehend during my younger years in grade school. But as I've gotten older and had more experiences, I've started to understand them a little better. So, here goes.

Mitsuru suggested that we write our own poems based on the same theme and see what happens. To say I was nervous is an understatement. I haven’t written anything poetic since my failed attempt at writing a rap song—which remains unfinished.

However, when she proposed that we write about masks since our prior conversations were already on this theme, I couldn’t help but smile in relief. This is a theme that I’ve thought about a lot, and two of my favorite poems, Genius of the Crowd and Bluebird, both by Charles Bukowski, are linked to this topic. I embedded a few YouTube videos that narrate my favorite poems below in the following section.

I ended up writing four poems in total—three that night and four in the morning—all of which I have included below. The fourth poem was a redo of the second poem because I thought it was lacking in depth and intensity. Enjoy! And let me know your thoughts!

## Poem #1

“Stopped at the crosswalk,
I watched the passersby,
Their suits the same color as mine.
Cars inching through this maze,
Destined to repeat in this world and the next,
Covered us in a gray haze.
A continuous drizzle fell from the ashen sky,
Pelting the umbrellas that keep us dry.

Then a car sped by,
Splashing me with water,
Turning my clothes black.
I instantly felt the gaze of those around me.

And like a tooth with a cavity,
I was drilled and injected with grout,
Once again restoring uniformity.”

## Poem #2

“Rinse, Repeat, Rinse, Repeat.
Every day I wash more of myself away.
I rinsed my face of its cakey make-up,
But still, it remained.
I removed my shirt, my pants, my underwear, my socks,
But still, it remained.
I stood looking at myself in the mirror,
But only the mask remained.”

## Poem #3

“To be in accordance,
With the unspoken laws,
Every day is a performance.

Disregarding their flaws,
And my particularity,
I remain on this stationary stage.

My life: a delicate flame,
With the gentlest breeze,
I am extinguished.
And like a candle,
I am easily replaced.”
— Oscar Shinozuka, 2021

## Poem #4

“With every passing storm,
However unwilling to conform,
A piece of me washes away.
Tainted by their ideology,
Shrouded in its hypocrisy,
It is me whom I betray.”
